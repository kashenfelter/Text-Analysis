Dollar Tree,"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657)
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) calls for
retailers and manufacturers to provide consumers with information regarding
their efforts in preventing slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains. To
this end, Dollar Tree, Inc., including its subsidiaries (collectively “Dollar Tree”),
provides the following information with regards to its position and efforts in
preventing slavery and human trafficking in its supply chain.
Dollar Tree maintains high expectations that its supply chain has the same
dedication as Dollar Tree to conducting business in a legal and ethical manner,
which includes prevention of human trafficking and slavery. Dollar Tree has no
tolerance for human trafficking and slavery in its supply chain.
To ensure Dollar Tree’s supply chain shares its beliefs and meets the company’s
expectations, the company internally evaluates potential risks by assessing its
supply chain with governmental and non-governmental resources on slavery and
human trafficking. Dollar Tree associates are alerted to look for indications of
human trafficking and slavery while visiting the factories of the company’s
suppliers. Dollar Tree also requires its suppliers to annually respond to surveys
regarding their efforts in preventing human trafficking and slavery. Further,
Dollar Tree contractually requires all of its suppliers to comply with applicable
labor laws and specifically requires in its Operating Guidelines for suppliers “to
not work with or arrange for purchase . . . any materials from business partners
who utilize prison or forced labor in any stage of the manufacture of our
products.” Failure to comply with Dollar Tree’s requirements will result in action,
including the severing of Dollar Tree’s business relationship. Dollar Tree also
holds its own associates to the same requirements of due diligence and failure to
meet these requirements will result in disciplinary action, including termination of
employment. Finally, to further ensure Dollar Tree’s associates and supply chain
meet the company’s expectations, Dollar Tree is requiring all associates with
direct responsibility for supply chain management be trained on the issue of
human trafficking and slavery.
Dollar Tree is committed to ensuring its supply chain does not participate in
human trafficking and slavery.

In all countries where we process products, our products are processed in facilities that comply with existing local laws. In our processing facilities, employees are provided with fair wages, regular working hours, and a clean working environment.
Harris Freeman's Supplier Code of Conduct makes clear our commitment to fair labor standards and helps ensure that we align ourselves with suppliers that share this commitment.

• Compliance with applicable laws, including those pertinent to equal employment opportunities, wages and benefits, and worker and product safety.

• Ethical business conduct based on compliance with the law, avoidance of conflicts of interest, and respect for the environment.
We seek to ensure that quality, safety and employment standards are maintained throughout our supply chain.

Verification and audit of product supply chains
Harris Freeman conducts annual assessment of its food sourcing suppliers to ensure our product suppliers are in compliance with our Code of Conduct.
Contracting Practices
Harris Freeman's Supplier Code of Conduct is designed to be embedded into our procurement practices (and thereby help assure such procurement is free from slavery and human trafficking) by:
• Including references to the Code of Conduct in major request for quotations;
• Incorporating language in all supply agreements and contracts requiring suppliers to warrant compliance with the Code of Conduct and acknowledge that any known violation may result in immediate termination of any and all business;
• Requiring acknowledgment of the Code of Conduct as part of an all new suppliers onboarding process; and
• Issuing the latest Code of Conduct to our current supplier community and allowing access to a website that uploads any revisions in the future.
Internal accountability and staff training
It is the Company's policy to be a good ""corporate citizen”. Wherever we do business, our employees are required to comply with all applicable laws.

Manchester Tank & Equipment Co.,"TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT DISCLOSURE
In 2012, California adopted the Transparency in Supply Chains Act requiring businesses to
disclose their efforts to combat slavery and human trafficking. McWane, Inc. has long been
aware that there are businesses throughout the world that engage in slavery and human
trafficking as a means of competing with those who operate in a humane manner and within
the law. McWane has been and continues to be committed to taking steps to ensure that it
does not do business with suppliers involved in such illegal and immoral activities.
McWane utilizes the services of eCustoms through its Visual Compliance program to screen
potential suppliers to confirm they are not on government denied party or restricted party lists.
The screening includes identification of those known to be engaging in human trafficking. This
program regularly and automatically re-screens those suppliers with whom the company is
currently doing business to ensure that these suppliers continue to operate lawfully and
ethically. In addition, the standard terms and conditions in a McWane purchase order issued to
a supplier include a requirement that McWane's suppliers as well as their material or
component suppliers comply with applicable laws concerning human trafficking and slavery.
Each supplier is required to acknowledge acceptance of the terms and conditions as a
prerequisite to issuance of a purchase order by McWane.
McWane does not currently conduct regular on-site audits of it suppliers to confirm that they
are not in violation of laws regarding slavery or human trafficking. McWane has made those in
each of its subsidiaries and divisions who are responsible for dealing with suppliers aware of the
need to ensure that the company does not engage in business with those who violate these
laws or are involved in other unethical business practices. While McWane has no specific
internal standards or procedures for dealing with its employees or contractors who fail to
perform properly with respect to issues relating to slavery and human trafficking, the company
will investigate any reported incidents of non-compliance and deal appropriately and decisively
in the event non-compliance is verified.

Outerwall Inc.,"in Supply Chains Act of 2010
In May 2014, Outerwall adopted a Supplier Code of Conduct .                      The Code applies to individuals and companies that supply goods and services to Outerwall and its subsidiaries.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct specifies that suppliers must ensure compliance with all applicable federal and local laws and regulations.                      The Supplier Code of Conduct includes requirements for compliance with all local and national minimum working age laws and forbids the use of child labor.                      Additionally, it stipulates that suppliers should pay at least the legally required minimum wage and provide all legally mandated benefits relevant to where                      the work is performed. Suppliers are required to abide by the maximum legally allowed number of working hours, using only voluntary labor.
Verification
Any new or renewed supplier contracts from May 2014 onward include a provision requiring compliance with the Code. Our corporate Supply Chain Management team maintains                      contracts with our largest and most critical suppliers as part of Outerwall's Strategic Supplier Program. These suppliers represent about 50% of our applicable spend and certify, annually, to adherence to Outerwall's Supplier Code of Conduct.
Audits
We conduct audits of our Strategic Suppliers on a case by case basis depending on their risk profile.
Certifications
Because key suppliers are required to sign contracts which specify they will adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct,                      these companies have certified that they are and will continue to be in compliance with our requirements.
Accountability
If Outerwall determines during an audit or another means that a supplier does not conform to Outerwall's standards,                      a determination regarding corrective action and/or whether to continue Outerwall's relationship with the supplier will be made on a case-by-case basis.

Georgia-Pacific Corrugated III LLC,"Verification
At Georgia-Pacific, we recognize the critical role we play in making products that improve lives and offer better solutions than other alternatives. Doing so sustainably requires that we balance the social, environmental and economic benefits and risks of our products, including how they are sourced, manufactured and used. Suppliers play a key role in our efforts to ensure that we manage our global supply chain in a sustainable way.
Direct Supplier Certification
Georgia-Pacific's commitment to ensuring that its supply chain is maintained in a socially responsible way includes, an expectation that suppliers not use forced labor in any of its forms, including human trafficking and slavery, to produce the products they provide to Georgia-Pacific.  These expectations are set out in the Georgia-Pacific Code of Conduct and the  Georgia-Pacific Supplier Sustainability Guidelines.   In addition, contracts with our suppliers obligate them to produce the products that we buy in a way that complies with applicable laws and regulations; at this time, however, Georgia-Pacific does not require suppliers to certify that they are in compliance.
Supplier Audits and Accountability Standards
To monitor compliance with the expectations of the Georgia-Pacific Supplier Sustainability Guidelines, Georgia-Pacific itself, instead of a third party vendor, assesses a number of its more than 30,000 suppliers. On an annual basis, suppliers are selected using a risk-based approach; supplier participation in this process is mandatory.
The three-stage assessment process includes a review of supplier responses to a detailed request for information. If during this review, Georgia-Pacific identifies any concerns or supplier responses require clarification, the supplier is moved into stage two, which includes a conference call or other meeting with that supplier to address the concern or clarification. If the issue cannot be resolved at this stage, the supplier is moved to stage three, which may include a supplier site audit. Depending on the nature of the concerns involved, these site audits may be unannounced. Failure to meet the Georgia-Pacific Supplier Sustainability Guidelines may result in discontinuation of the supplier relationship.
Training on Human Trafficking and Slavery
Since implementing this assessment process, Georgia-Pacific has educated its procurement organization and others in the organization on this process and the Supplier Sustainability Guidelines. Further educational efforts regarding these expectations may include face-to-face meetings, web-based seminars and computer-based training, and will focus on how employees can assist Georgia-Pacific in mitigating risks within its supply chain.

"HM Electronics, Inc.","The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act – Disclosures
It is our policy to ensure that our supply chain reflects our values and respect for human rights.
Accordingly, we take the following steps to confront slavery and human trafficking in our direct
supply chains:
     1. Verifications
We conduct assessments of our product suppliers to verify that they are not at risk for violating
anti-slavery and human trafficking laws. We do not use third-party verifiers. Our own materials
management team spearheads the verification process using an internally developed assessment.
We are currently unable to verify whether our subcontractors use labor brokers.
     2. Supplier Audits
Our internal materials management team reserves the right to conduct announced audits of our
direct suppliers to evaluate their compliance with our anti-slavery and human trafficking
company standards. Audits consist of individual and group interviews with supervisors and
management, as well as exhaustive facility tours.
     3. Certification
We require our direct suppliers to certify that they comply with anti-slavery and human
trafficking laws in the country or countries in which they do business.
     4. Accountability
In 2012, we developed internal accountability standards and procedures for employees and
contractors failing to meet our company standards regarding slavery and trafficking. If and when
our company uncovers employee or contractor compliance problems, we provide written notice
and a specified period of time to take corrective action.
     5. Training
Employees who are responsible for materials management are trained on the importance of
making sure our suppliers are not engaged in violations of the company’s policies prohibiting
forced labor, slavery and human trafficking. Our company does not provide contractors with
training on human trafficking and slavery.

The Colgate-Palmolive Company,"                         State of California Disclosure: Supply Chain Transparency
Beginning in 2012, large manufacturers and retailers doing business in California are required under the
California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) to disclose efforts that they have taken to
eliminate human trafficking and slavery from their supply chains. The purpose of this law is to make more
information available so that consumers are better enabled to make informed decisions about the
products they purchase and the companies they choose to support.
Colgate-Palmolive Company has a policy that strictly prohibits all forced servitude and child labor
practices and has taken important steps over the years to ensure the integrity of its supply chains and the
Company at large. The following is an overview of the Company’s programs in this area:
        Supplier Assessment and Audit Process: In the first quarter of 2012, the Company is rolling
         out on a global basis a comprehensive Supplier Responsible Sourcing Assessment process that
         will be conducted with both existing suppliers and new suppliers. This program augments the
         Company’s preexisting supplier audit program in significant respects, including its focus on four
         critical areas: labor standards, health & safety, environmental management, and business
         integrity. This risk-management-based program includes identification of risks in the supply chain,
         self-assessment by suppliers against established standards, third party audits of suppliers’
         facilities against established standards, and a remediation procedure for resolution of identified
         noncompliance with the standards. The remediation process includes supplier corrective action
         plans and follow-up activities. The program’s objective is to ensure that Colgate’s responsible
         sourcing standards, as described in the Company’s Supplier Code of Conduct (discussed further
         below), are being followed in practice by Colgate’s suppliers. A very significant portion of the
         assessment process is the evaluation of labor practices, including ensuring that no illegal child
         labor or forced servitude practices are present.
        Supplier Adherence to Applicable Laws and Colgate’s Code of Conduct: Under Colgate’s
         contracts with suppliers, suppliers are required to comply with all applicable federal, state, local,
         and municipal laws and regulations, including all applicable labor and other workplace laws and
         regulations. Further, Colgate’s contracts bind suppliers to adhere to the Company’s Supplier
         Code of Conduct, which requires suppliers to abide by the Company’s policy prohibiting the use
         of illegal child labor, involuntary servitude, exploitation of children, and all other forms of abusive
         or exploitative labor practices. The Supplier Code of Conduct, which is modeled on the
         International Labor Organization (ILO) standards, further states the Company’s policy against
         working with any supplier that is known to operate with unacceptable worker treatment, such as
         physical punishment, female abuse, involuntary servitude or other forms of abuse, and obligates
         suppliers to take appropriate steps to ensure that they do not engage in any of these practices. It
         is Colgate’s policy that violation of these principles is grounds for termination of any business
         relationship.
        Accountability: Like the Supplier Code of Conduct discussed above, the Company’s Code of
         Conduct reflects the Company’s prohibition on exploitative labor practices and binds employees
         to these requirements. Violation of the Code of Conduct may lead to disciplinary action up to and
         including termination.
        Training: Colgate requires 100% of employees to complete training on the Company’s Code of
         Conduct and to acknowledge compliance with the Code. The 2012 training cycle will address the
         Company’s policies against exploitative labor practices.

At Camping World and Camping World RV Sales, we have worked hard to become the nation's largest RV and outdoor retailer and attribute our success to remaining true to our Core Values, which focus on ethical conduct, supporting our local community, and constantly improving. We expect that our associates and business partners share these Core Values and understand that our local community extends to those who work hard each day to create products that end up in our homes and on our roads.
While this expectation informs how we do business, the State of California asks that we tell you a little more about how Camping World and Camping World RV Sales work with the companies that bring us the products we offer to you:
First and foremost, it is Camping World's policy not to purchase any products made or acquired in any way through the use of forced labor or human trafficking. Our direct importer commits to following this policy and performs routine audits of factories where our products are made and takes prompt action to maintain compliance with local laws. Similarly, Camping World's vendors commit to us that the products we purchase comply with all applicable laws.
Because of this expectation, Camping World and Camping World RV Sales do not currently verify, internally or through a third party, their respective product supply chains to evaluate and address the risks of human trafficking and forced labor. Neither Camping World nor Camping World RV Sales independently audit suppliers to evaluate compliance with our expectation that the supply chains are free from human trafficking and forced labor. Neither Camping World nor Camping World RV Sales require suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the final products comply with local anti-trafficking and forced labor laws. While Camping World and Camping World RV Sales expect our associates to share our Core Values, we do not maintain separate internal accountability standards and procedures for associates or contractors who fail to meet our standards regarding human trafficking and forced labor. Finally, neither Camping World nor Camping World RV Sales provide associates or management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management training on human trafficking and forced labor.

"Materion Corporation (incl subsidiaries Materion Brush Inc and Materion Advanced Materials Technologies and Services, Inc.","California Transparency in Supply Chain Act Disclosure
Materion Corporation, including its subsidiaries and affiliates (“Materion”), will never use forced, indentured or involuntary labor in any of our operations nor will we tolerate any instances of forced labor or human trafficking.  We will also never conduct business with any third parties who engage in human trafficking or other forced labor. This commitment is set forth in Materion’s Code of Conduct, which applies to all Materion employees, officers and directors. Training is provided to employees generally on the Code of Conduct requirements, and this training generally addresses the mitigation of the risk of slavery and human trafficking within the supply chain.  The employees and management who have direct responsibility for the supply chain are aware of their obligation to mitigate these risks and are empowered to immediately address and resolve any event of potential noncompliance.  
Materion similarly prohibits any form of forced labor, including slavery and human trafficking, in our supply chain, and has issued the Materion Supplier Code of Conduct (the “Supplier Code”).  The Supplier Code, among other things, specifically forbids the use of involuntary or forced labor, including unlawful child labor, and requires that suppliers comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding slavery and human trafficking.  The Supplier Code also requires that suppliers ensure that their subcontractors and agents comply with the Supplier Code, and have adequate monitoring and record keeping systems in place to ensure compliance.  The Supplier Code expressly provides that Materion reserves the right to monitor, review and verify compliance with the Supplier Code.  In addition, key direct material suppliers are required to annually acknowledge their compliance with the Supplier Code through an on-line certification procedure.  
Materion has introduced an enhanced supplier audit program that targets key direct material suppliers to ensure compliance with Materion’s strict policy against the use of forced, indentured, or involuntary labor.  This program allows Materion to independently verify, evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery within the supply chain.  As set forth above, the annual certification process requires key direct suppliers to certify that all materials or products supplied to Materion comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in all countries in which they are doing business.  This verification and audit process is conducted internally and at this time is not conducted through independent unannounced audits.
Any concerns relating to potential noncompliance with Materion’s Code of Conduct or the Supplier Code are investigated promptly.  Any employee, officer, director or supplier who violates these policies is subject to discipline, up to and including termination.

Georgia-Pacific Gypsum LLC,"Verification
At Georgia-Pacific, we recognize the critical role we play in making products that improve lives and offer better solutions than other alternatives. Doing so sustainably requires that we balance the social, environmental and economic benefits and risks of our products, including how they are sourced, manufactured and used. Suppliers play a key role in our efforts to ensure that we manage our global supply chain in a sustainable way.
Direct Supplier Certification
Georgia-Pacific's commitment to ensuring that its supply chain is maintained in a socially responsible way includes, an expectation that suppliers not use forced labor in any of its forms, including human trafficking and slavery, to produce the products they provide to Georgia-Pacific.  These expectations are set out in the Georgia-Pacific Code of Conduct and the  Georgia-Pacific Supplier Sustainability Guidelines.   In addition, contracts with our suppliers obligate them to produce the products that we buy in a way that complies with applicable laws and regulations; at this time, however, Georgia-Pacific does not require suppliers to certify that they are in compliance.
Supplier Audits and Accountability Standards
To monitor compliance with the expectations of the Georgia-Pacific Supplier Sustainability Guidelines, Georgia-Pacific itself, instead of a third party vendor, assesses a number of its more than 30,000 suppliers. On an annual basis, suppliers are selected using a risk-based approach; supplier participation in this process is mandatory.
The three-stage assessment process includes a review of supplier responses to a detailed request for information. If during this review, Georgia-Pacific identifies any concerns or supplier responses require clarification, the supplier is moved into stage two, which includes a conference call or other meeting with that supplier to address the concern or clarification. If the issue cannot be resolved at this stage, the supplier is moved to stage three, which may include a supplier site audit. Depending on the nature of the concerns involved, these site audits may be unannounced. Failure to meet the Georgia-Pacific Supplier Sustainability Guidelines may result in discontinuation of the supplier relationship.
Training on Human Trafficking and Slavery
Since implementing this assessment process, Georgia-Pacific has educated its procurement organization and others in the organization on this process and the Supplier Sustainability Guidelines. Further educational efforts regarding these expectations may include face-to-face meetings, web-based seminars and computer-based training, and will focus on how employees can assist Georgia-Pacific in mitigating risks within its supply chain.

DISCLOSURE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT OF 2010
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires retailers and manufacturers to disclose its efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from its supply chain. Benefit is opposed to human trafficking and forced labor at any level, and we are committed to ensuring that the manufacturers and suppliers we work with meet our standards. Below are our required disclosures under the Act.
Benefit engages in verification of its product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. This verification is conducted through an audit by a Benefit Quality Assurance Manager, and/or by third parties.
Benefit conducts independent announced audits of its suppliers to evaluate their compliance with our standards for human trafficking and slavery. This audit is conducted on all new vendors that perform a service, manufacture product or manufacture any type of packing or collateral component for Benefit. All new vendors must pass the audit before business is awarded. Benefit also selects certain existing vendors to be subject to continued audits on a periodic basis. Benefit conducts these audits as an integral part of its quality assurance process, and uses a social accountability checklist that audits the supplier’s practices relating to child labor, forced labor, discrimination, wage and working conditions.
Benefit is in the process of requiring all suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into Benefit products comply with the laws regarding human trafficking and slavery of the country or countries in which the suppliers are doing business.
Benefit maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for contractors and suppliers failing to meet company standards regarding human trafficking and slavery. Specifically, Benefit’s audit procedures require each vendor to pass the social accountability audit in order to continue doing business with Benefit.
Benefit does not at this time provide company employees and management with specific training on human trafficking and slavery; however, Benefit is in the process of setting up mandatory training for all employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management with respect to mitigating risks of human trafficking and slavery within our product supply chain.

California Transparency in Supply Chains Act
As required under the California Transparency Supply Chain Act, we are disclosing our efforts to mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain.
Verification
DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. is committed to fair labor practices throughout the supply chain. New and existing private brand contracted factories are regularly assessed against our Workplace Standards and Code of Conduct (below) which are based on International Labour Organization standards. Assessments are initiated based on geographic location, workplace history or previous audit record and other policy requirements. These audits are performed by DICK'S Compliance Team members and also by third party verifiers. Results are reviewed by Compliance Managers, who assist factories in remediating issues identified during audits, share key performance data with internal business partners as appropriate, and also engage with industry and NGO stakeholders to identify strategic opportunities to improve working conditions. DICK'S is a Better Work Buyer Partner (www.betterwork.org) and leverages the Better Work program to engage with key factories in countries where Better Work operates.
Auditing
Each year DICK'S audits a significant percentage of our private brand contract factories to determine if they are in compliance with our standards, which in addition to requiring compliance with local laws on working hours, wages and health and safety concerns, also prohibit forced, slave or child labor. Audits are performed by DICK'S compliance personnel or third party verifiers and are semi-unannounced within a negotiated time frame. Annual and follow-up audit frequency is determined in accordance with our policy and is based in part on the level of risk and non-compliance determined by previous audit results.
Certification
As part of the supplier onboarding process, all vendors are required to certify that they conduct business in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations which include any existing laws on slavery and human trafficking in the country of manufacture. DICK'S certifies private brand factories into various risk levels and active status categories. Detailed Corrective Action Plans are required within 14 days for any non-compliance with local law or our Code. Factories must exhibit continuous improvement, transparency, and management cooperation to ensure continued certification and business eligibility. Additional follow up audits are required until high risk issues are resolved. Lack of continuous improvement may result in termination of the business relationship. Factories that demonstrate low risk and strong management systems have opportunities to reduce the frequency of audits.
Internal Accountability
The Director of Global Ethics & Compliance, who reports to the Chief Compliance Officer, is responsible for overseeing the compliance and factory monitoring programs. The Director works with the DICK'S compliance team to ensure that the Factory Compliance Policy is followed and with Product Development and Sourcing teams to integrate key performance data into the sourcing business process and to address high risk factories. In addition to requiring corrective actions and remediation of identified non-compliances, DICK'S actively encourages factories to take ownership of compliance management and implement root cause/management systems based approaches to facilitate sustainable improvement. In addition to working with factory management, DICK'S strategically communicates responsible sourcing guidelines to internal business partners and vendors and also provides ""hotline"" channels for workers that we engage during factory visits.
Training
DICK'S provides annual training to relevant associates and business units on our Workplace Standards, Code of Conduct and program requirements. Training is conducted with management level associates in roles related to sourcing, product development, quality assurance and who interact with or travel to factories and may be in the best position to identify issues. Training on responsible sourcing guidelines and program expectations is also conducted in annual meetings with vendors and factories.
DICK'S Workplace Standards and Code of Conduct for Vendors
General Principle
Business partners must comply fully with all legal requirements relevant to the conduct of their businesses.
Forced Labor
Business partners must not use forced labor, whether in the form of prison labour, indentured labour, trafficked labour, bonded labour or otherwise. No employee may be compelled to work through force or intimidation of any form, or as a means of political coercion or as punishment for holding or expressing political views.
Child Labor
Business partners must not employ children who are less than 15 years old, or less than the age for completing compulsory education in the country of manufacture where such age is higher than 15.
Discrimination
Business partners must not discriminate in recruitment and employment practices. Decisions about hiring, salary, benefits, training opportunities, work assignments, advancement, discipline and termination must be based solely on ability to perform the job, rather than on the basis of personal characteristics or beliefs, such as race, national origin, gender, religion, age, disability, marital status, parental status, association membership, sexual orientation or political opinion. Additionally, business partners must implement effective measures to protect migrant employees against any form of discrimination and to provide appropriate support services that reflect their special status.
Wages & Benefits
Wages must equal or exceed the minimum wage required by law and legally mandated benefits must be provided. In addition to compensation for regular working hours, employees must be compensated for overtime hours at the rate legally required in the country of manufacture or, in those countries where such laws do not exist, at a rate exceeding the regular hourly compensation rate.
Working Hours
Employees must not be required, except in extraordinary circumstances, to work more than 60 hours per week including overtime or the local legal requirement, whichever is less. Employees must be allowed at least 24 consecutive hours rest within every seven-day period, and must receive paid annual leave.
Freedom of Association & Collective Bargaining
Business partners must recognize and respect the right of employees to join and organize associations of their own choosing and to bargain collectively. Business partners must develop and fully implement mechanisms for resolving industrial disputes, including employee grievances, and ensure effective communication with employees and their representatives.
Disciplinary Practices
Employees must be treated with respect and dignity. No employee may be subjected to any physical, sexual, psychological or verbal harassment or abuse or to fines or penalties as a disciplinary measure.Business partners must publicize and enforce a non-retaliation policy that permits factory employees to express their concerns about workplace conditions directly to factory management or to us without fear of retribution or losing their jobs.
Health & Safety
A safe and hygienic working environment must be provided, and occupational health and safety practices which prevent accidents and injury must be promoted. This includes protection from fire, accidents and toxic substances. Lighting, heating and ventilation systems must be adequate. Employees must have access at all times to sanitary facilities which should be adequate and clean. Business partners must have health and safety policies which are clearly communicated to employees. Where residential facilities are provided to employees, the same standards apply.
Environmental Requirements
Business partners must ensure they are compliant with local and national laws regarding the environment, including regulatory agency requirements designed to limit consumer exposure to harmful chemicals.

Bernhardt Furniture Company,"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 Disclosure
Bernhardt Furniture Company (Bernhardt) endeavors to conduct business in compliance with all laws and with widely accepted norms of fairness and human decency, and expects its suppliers to do the same. Bernhardt is committed to protecting the human rights and safety of the people who produce its products, raw materials and component parts used in production, while also recognizing and respecting the cultural and legal differences found throughout the world. Bernhardt pursues these goals through a variety of means; this disclosure is focused specifically on meeting the requirements of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act.
Bernhardt prohibits illegal child labor, compulsory prison or slave labor, indentured labor, physical abuse of workers, corruption and unfair business practices in its operations and those of its suppliers. While Bernhardt does not typically require third party audits of suppliers’ facilities in regards to such illegal practices, Bernhardt expects its suppliers to maintain compliance programs around labor laws and to be able to demonstrate a satisfactory record of such compliance. Bernhardt personnel routinely visit suppliers and exercise Bernhardt’s right to inspect facilities during announced and unannounced visits. The frequency of such visits and inspections is generally related to the volume and importance of the goods or services supplied to Bernhardt’s overall operations.
While Bernhardt does not maintain an internal training program focused specifically on supplier labor law compliance and mitigating risks of labor law violations within the supply chains, managers responsible for purchasing decisions are informed of these risks and are expected to make the compliance expectations of Bernhardt known to the vendors and suppliers of goods and services. In some cases, written purchasing contracts are in place which expressly require the supplier, among other things, to comply with labor laws, which would include prohibitions against forced or child labor.
Bernhardt expects suppliers of goods and services to provide at a minimum the same scrutiny of their own supply chain to verify that those suppliers also comply with the labor laws of the country or countries in which they are doing business. At times, Bernhardt personnel visit and inspect the facilities of some of those upstream suppliers as well.
Bernhardt will address any identified violations or compliance issues with vendors and suppliers of goods and service on an individual basis. If prompt remediation does not occur or in cases where attempts at remediation are not judged credible, Bernhardt will cease to do business with the supplier.
Environment
Bernhardt is committed to environmental excellence in all of its business activities - from the design of its products to its manufacturing processes.
We want to go beyond simply complying with environmental legislation and regulations; we want to become leading supporters in our community and industry ~ Alex Bernhardt, Sr., Chairman and CEO, Bernhardt Furniture Company
As a family-owned and operated company, we care a great deal about the health and welfare of our employees, our customers, our suppliers, our community, and our planet. We have a long-standing corporate tradition of providing a safe and healthful work place, protecting the environment, and conserving energy and natural resources. This tradition has served the environment and our business well over the years and now provides the foundation for a comprehensive set of Environmental Policy Objectives. These objectives include:
Energy Use
Water Use
Employee Awareness and Involvement
As a sign of our commitment, we have launched a number of company-wide initiatives that focus on meeting these objectives. Corporately, we have received EFEC (Enhancing Furniture's Environmental Culture) certification for five of our U.S. facilities, including our Corporate Office, and our divisions are developing programs with environmental groups such as SFI, FSC, and GREENGUARD, or in support of LEED, as appropriate. In addition, we are communicating and partnering with our suppliers, governmental agencies, our trade associations and our community to assist us in achieving results consistent with environmental leadership.
We believe that protecting our environment is the right thing to do. That is why we pledge to promote sound and sustainable business practices for the benefit of all those who depend upon us now and for those who will depend upon us in years to come.

Questions
Human Rights Policy
One of the core values of QEP, is our deep respect for Human Rights.
QEP supports international principles aimed at protecting and promoting human rights.  QEP supports and respects the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights, making sure QEP is not complicit in human rights abuses:
QEP respects and implements across all QEP companies the international laws, in particular the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions and the UN Global Compact principles.
Human rights are fundamental principles which allow individuals the freedom to lead a dignified and independent life, free from abuse and violations.  They are based on rules of human behavior, common across diverse cultures.  Where human rights are not adhered to, this can have a significant impact on the performance of our employees, as well as our business.
In furtherance of this policy QEP recognizes the significant human rights issues within the supply chain and our responsibility to work with suppliers and partners to protect the human rights of workers within factories.
Our suppliers are required to adhere to all applicable domestic and international laws in the countries in which they operate including, but not limited to, laws on slavery and human trafficking.  We ask our suppliers to reinforce awareness of potential human rights issues inside their own organization as well as in the organizations of their suppliers.  QEP also asks its global suppliers to pay wages and maintain benefits in compliance with local law, only employ workers who meet the local minimum age, and employ individuals who are not subject to forced, bonded or involuntary labor.
California Transparency in Supply Chain Act Disclosure
The state of California pursuant to the California Transparency in Supply Chain Act of 2010 requires manufacturers and retailers to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chain.  QEP is therefore disclosing that:
We verify that our primary suppliers are not involved in human trafficking and slavery by regularly surveying those suppliers.  We conduct such verifications by our own staff.
We conduct audits of suppliers to evaluate compliance and do so by our own staff.
We ask our direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery/human trafficking of the country or countries in which they do business.
We maintain internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet our standards regarding slavery and trafficking.
We provide employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management training on slavery /trafficking.

Merisant Company,"The California Transparency in Supply Chain Act of 2010 (SB 657) requires large retailers and manufacturers doing business in California to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains for tangible goods offered for sale. To this end, the law directs Merisant to inform the public as to how it has addressed the following issues:
Verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery.  The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not conducted by a third party.
Audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not an independent, unannounced audit.
Certification by direct suppliers that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.
Internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking.
Training of company employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management on issues of human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products.
This webpage is intended to fulfill these requirements.
Merisant US, Inc. manufactures its products in Illinois using ingredients sourced from a limited number of qualified suppliers that must meet Merisant's strict quality standards.  All of the ingredients used to manufacture Merisant's products have been processed using skilled and semi-skilled labor in sophisticated production facilities that are often located in countries where substantive labor and health and safety laws exist and are enforced. Merisant's suppliers are by contract required to comply with all applicable laws. Merisant employees periodically conduct quality control audits, and use other tools, to assess suppliers' production facilities.
Merisant's management has assessed the risk that its direct suppliers might violate applicable laws against slavery and human trafficking. Management has determined that this risk is negligible. Based on this risk assessment, Merisant has not implemented internal accountability standards and procedures or training programs specifically targeted at this issue and has not engaged third-party auditors to verify that its suppliers comply with applicable laws against slavery and human trafficking.  However, if management believes that such a risk is possible due to an ingredient's country of origin or other factors, Merisant may request and receive written certifications from suppliers that the suppliers do not violate applicable laws against slavery and human trafficking.

"True Religion Apparel, Inc.","THE TRUE STORY: THE STITCH THAT STARTED IT ALL
In 2002, True Religion emerged onto the Los Angeles denim scene by blowing up the construction of the classic five-pocket jean. Industry-standard sewing machines couldn't handle our designs, so we broke them apart and rebuilt them to produce our one-of-a-kind vision. With its five-needle thread at two-stitch-per-inch process, our Super T stitch was instantly recognized for style that was unlike any other denim brand in the world.
True Religion's designs soon caught the attention of the world's most iconic style leaders, and demand for our denim grew rapidly. Everything from there on out was committed to be bigger, better, and bolder than the rest.
As our stitching evolved, True Religion became synonymous with quality craftsmanship and bold style designed to stand out. Our specialty denim fits, washes & treatments, were all designed with amplified details to grab attention at every turn. Our iconic horseshoe was born from the silhouette of a Buddha's smile, and our hardware was inspired by the romance of denim's 140-year history. We have always been fashion forward, even from behind.
Our styles inherit the swagger of their given name. The Joey. The Ricky. The Halle. However, it's the Fearless Style Leaders who rock True Religion with a Be So Bold attitude that ignite the world with bold statements of creative self-expression. We became famous because we were like no one before us, and what began with a stitch now leads to a future of innovative fashion designed by the fearless, for the fearless.
Corporate Responsibility
True Religion Apparel, Inc., together with its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the “Company”), is dedicated to upholding fair and legal employment practices and environmental sustainability requirements.
As an integral component of this commitment, we have developed and implemented a Vendor Code of Conduct (the “Code,” available here ), which applies to all vendors, manufacturers, contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers (“Vendors”) that form a part of our supply chain.
The Code advises our Vendors of their obligation to adhere to all applicable local, state (including the California Transparency in Supply Chain Act) and federal laws as well as the standards established by the Company and set forth in the Code.
The core elements of our Code are prohibitions on discrimination, forced labor, and child labor, insistence on fair wages and hours and the provision of safe and healthy working conditions, as well as guidelines for minimizing each Vendor’s environmental footprint.
As a condition of doing business with the Company, each Vendor must execute the Code and implement the principles contained therein.
The Company will continue to develop Vendor monitoring systems including, but not limited to, independent, unannounced third party audits to assess and ensure compliance with the Code.
If the Company determines that any Vendor has violated the Code, the Company may either terminate its business relationship or require the Vendor to implement a corrective action plan.

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires qualifying retailers and manufacturers doing business in the state of California to disclose efforts to eradicate human trafficking and slavery from its supply chains. The following is the response of Alamo Group Inc., on behalf of itself and all of its member companies.
With our global operations that import and export goods and services, it is the policy of Alamo Group Inc., as well as all of our member companies, to observe and comply with all laws applicable to us and our operations wherever our business is located, including, while not referenced directly by name, anti-slavery and human trafficking laws. This policy is enshrined within our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Procedures (the ""Code""). All of our employees, officers and directors are asked to adhere to the Code.
Any violations or suspected violations of the Code are encouraged to be reported promptly. We have an ""open door"" policy which allows employees to take their concerns to higher levels of management. We also have systems in place for the submitting of anonymous reports of any violations or suspected violations. It is a violation of the Code to fail to report violations of the Code or to intimidate or impose any form of retribution on any covered party who in good faith reports suspected violations.
Disciplinary measures which may be invoked for Code violations include, but are not limited to, counseling, oral or written reprimands, warnings, probation or suspension without pay, demotions, reductions in salary, termination of employment and restitution, depending, among other things, on the severity and frequency of the violations.
Currently, we do not: (1) engage in verification of product supply chains to evaluate or address risks of human trafficking and slavery; (2) conduct audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with anti-slavery and human trafficking standards; (3) require our suppliers to certify that they comply with anti-slavery and human trafficking laws in the country or countries in which they do business; (4) other than as set forth in our Code, maintain internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors for failing to meet anti-slavery and human trafficking standards; or (5) provide company employees or management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management with training on anti-slavery and human trafficking laws.

Certification. The Company does not require suppliers to certify that products are made in compliance with the laws regarding human trafficking and slavery of the countries in which they are doing business; however, we will consider this option if it is determined a vendor is considered to be high risk.

Re: California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657)
On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) took effect in the State of California. The Act seeks the elimination of slavery and human trafficking from product supply chains and requires that companies disclose their efforts to ensure that their supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking.
SMC Ltd. (“SMC”) is dedicated to conducting business in a lawful and ethical manner and supports human rights, ethical labor practices, and environmental protection standards.
In support of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657), SMC will uphold our commitment through the following practices:
Risk Assessments: SMC continues to evaluate the risk of our suppliers being involved in slavery or human trafficking. Attention will be paid to suppliers that provide goods or services that are listed on the “List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor” as published by the Office of Labor, Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking. Current suppliers who may be at high risk will be contacted to make them aware of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB-657). In addition, new suppliers are asked to state that they are in compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) when they complete a Supplier Self Survey form. This verification is conducted by SMC Ltd. employees and not by a third party.
Auditing: SMC performs audits as required.
Certification Requirement: SMC prefers to source its raw materials from domestic suppliers, and the company expects all suppliers to abide by applicable federal, international and local laws, rules, and regulations in the manufacture and distribution of materials supplied. However, we do not presently require our suppliers to certify their materials. Although we do require our suppliers to maintain records to substantiate that all materials it supplies are produced in compliance with the anti-slavery and human trafficking laws of the country or countries in which they operate. Such records may include written policies and procedures that ensure adherence to all elements of the Act, as well as personnel files for every worker, including proof of age, executed employment contract (where necessary by law), and a true and accurate record of hours and wages.
Employee Standards of Conduct: SMC requires that all employees act in a responsible and ethical manner in all activities in the workplace. All activities are governed by honesty, fair dealing, integrity, and full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Any employees not adhering to this policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
Employee Training: SMC conducts training for employees whose job functions include procurement that emphasizes the importance of ensuring SMC’s supplier base abide by the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 and its prohibition on slavery and human trafficking.

To evaluate and address the risks of slavery and human trafficking in our product supply chains under the Act, INFICON’s verification process consists solely of asking our most significant direct suppliers, based on spend, of materials incorporated into their products to comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the countries in which they are doing business.  We have ongoing interaction, conduct regular visits, and perform internal audits of these most significant suppliers.  We do not engage third party auditors to conduct independent and unannounced audits of our suppliers. We do not require our suppliers to certify to specific laws regarding slavery and human trafficking, however they do certify to compliance with all statutes, rules, regulations and orders of the United States as well as the countries in which they are doing business. 
INFICON has training on our Global Business and Ethics Policies, which includes a specific sub-section on ‘Prevention of Child or Forced Labor’, for all company employees.  INFICON’s Global Business and Ethics Policies contain a mechanism to report potential ethical, legal or regulatory violations related to our employees and all business partners.  We have internal accountability standards and procedures in the event an employee fails to meet company Business and Ethics Policies.  INFICON has not developed specific training nor accountability procedures related to slavery and human trafficking for its supply chain partners, however all supplier relationships may be terminated for violations of all statutes, rules, regulations and orders of the United States as well as the countries in which they are doing business.

"L & M Footwear, Inc. DBA Robert Wayne Footwear DBA Shoeteria","Supplier Responsibility
Disclosure Statement Pursuant to California Transparency in Supply chains Act of 2010
Robert Wayne Footwear is a divison of L&M Footwear, Inc. L&M Footwear is committed to the highest standards of social responsibility. As part of this commitment we are obligated to ensure our products are produced in an ethical and legal manner. L&M Footwear takes seriously the federal and international efforts to end human trafficking and slavery.
Supply Chain Verification
L&M Footwear’s policy is to evaluate potential contracted factories before they enter the supply chain to assess compliance with standards including country-related risk for issues including human trafficking and slavery. We source our products and materials from suppliers that we believe to be both reputable and compliant with applicable laws and their own internal standards and policies prohibiting slavery and human trafficking. Although we currently do not have formal policies or procedures of our own in place, we believe that the company employees responsible for managing our supply chain have sufficient knowledge and experience to evaluate and asses the risks posed by each supplier, and to detect potential warning signs that a supplier may be failing to adhere to the proper standards or to monitor and ensure compliance by its own supply sources.
Supply Chain Certification
L&M Footwear does not currently have a formal supplier compliance verification program in place. However, we remain committed to evaluating and revising our practices, and are working on developing standards for supplier certification including the creation of a Supplier’s Code of Conduct that will expand in detail our expectations of our suppliers regarding human rights, and establishment of standards and procedures for suppliers that fail to meet our company requirements regarding forced labor and trafficking.
Training and Internal Accountability
In light of the knowledge and experience of our existing supply chain partners, we have not instituted formal employee training programs, nor have we utilized the services of outside third parties to audit or verify supplier compliance. Those employees and management with direct responsibility for supply chain management and audits are provided information on L&M Footwear’s policies with regard to forced labor, including human trafficking and slavery. These employees and management cooperate with suppliers to correct any breaches of employment, health, safety and environmental precedent and practices, and specifically for any type of forced labor. If employees of L&M Footwear who are responsible for direct responsibility of supply chain management fail to fulfil their duties, they may be subject to discipline.

Sun Chemical Corporation,"Sun Chemical’s Disclosure regarding the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657)
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (CTSCA) was approved by the Governor of California on September 30, of 2010. The act begins by declaring that slavery and human trafficking are crimes under state, federal, and international law and requires that retailers and manufacturers doing business in the state of California disclose efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from its direct supply chain to tangible goods offered for sale.
As a responsible corporate citizen, Sun Chemical seeks to ensure that quality and safety standards are maintained throughout our supply chain by well-treated, fairly compensated workers in accordance with all applicable laws. To that end, and in response to the CTSCA, Sun Chemical states:
1. Sun Chemical has published standards prohibiting our suppliers from engaging in slavery and human trafficking. In addition, Sun Chemical’s terms and conditions on our purchase orders ask suppliers to represent and warrant that they do not and will not knowingly use any slave labor or engage in any human trafficking. Because of what we believe to be low risk in our supply chain, we do not currently audit our suppliers for compliance. However, Sun Chemical will consider more intense measures such as auditing or third party verification for any suppliers we determine that are of medium or high risk. If we suspect a supplier is involved in these activities, we will conduct an inquiry. If we find evidence of slavery and human trafficking at the supplier, we expect the supplier to take corrective action to resolve the issues within 90 days.
2. Sun Chemical asks our suppliers to verify in writing that they do not engage in slavery or human trafficking, and that the supplier requires at least the same degree of compliance certified in writing from all of its suppliers of materials used in goods sold to Sun Chemical.
3. In addition to requiring that suppliers renounce and abstain from human trafficking and slavery, we also ask that our suppliers comply with all applicable discrimination and labor laws.
4. Sun Chemical employees are required to attend training concerning issues surrounding slavery and human trafficking in the supply chain, including training for employees that work with our supply chain and contractors on the issues involved with slavery and human trafficking as well as identification of risk.

"LaCrosse Footwear, Inc.","California transparency statement
To address the regulations of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657), LaCrosse Footwear defines slavery as “the act of holding the worker against his or her will and controlled physically or psychologically by violence or its threat for the purpose of appropriating their labor” as used by Free the Slaves (FTS). FTS is an international non-governmental organization (NGO) that campaigns against the modern practice of slavery throughout the world and is the largest anti-slavery organization in the United States.
LaCrosse Footwear defines human trafficking as “any recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery” as defined in the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protections Act (TVPA) of 2000.
LaCrosse Footwear assesses the risk of slavery and human trafficking thru a preliminary audit of its supply chain in order to qualify that supplier. This audit is performed by LaCrosse Footwear on potential suppliers thru factory visits by a contingent of LaCrosse Footwear's employees who work within supply chain functions. Audit includes on-site inspections, vendor profile assessment and Vendor Acknowledgement and Agreement.
LaCrosse Footwear conducts follow up inspections of direct suppliers. We have developed and issued a code of conduct in our Vendor Acknowledgement and Agreement to our direct suppliers. Direct suppliers are evaluated on their compliance to our code though continued factory visits and monitoring.
LaCrosse Footwear's purchasing agreements require all suppliers to comply with our Vendor Acknowledgement and Agreement and applicable laws within the country, or countries, they do business regarding slavery and human trafficking.
LaCrosse Footwear maintains and enforces internal accountability procedures for employees and contractors regarding company standards in slavery and human trafficking. In the case of non-compliance, LaCrosse Footwear reserves the right to examine the specific situation and develop a best possible strategy for resolution. If cases of non-compliance are not resolved within a timely manner, LaCrosse Footwear may terminate the business relationship. While LaCrosse Footwear wishes to aid in the resolution of incidences of human trafficking and slavery within LaCrosse Footwear's supply chain, it is not possible to effectively solve the issue of noncompliance without the cooperation of the supplier.
LaCrosse Footwear conducts internal training on LaCrosse Footwear's code of conduct to ensure the necessary participants in supply chain management are knowledgeable and aware of the issues and concerns surrounding the supply chain, including human trafficking and slavery, with a particular focus on mitigating risks. LaCrosse Footwear also encourages employees involved in LaCrosse Footwear's supply chain to participate in external training programs and seminars on social compliance issues, including on the issues of human trafficking and slavery.

Kate Spade & Company ,"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act which is effective on January 1, 2012, requires companies doing business in California and exceeding a volume threshold, to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in its direct supply chain for tangible goods offered for sale.
Kate Spade & Company's Standards of Engagement include the prohibition of forced labor and child labor. Click here for the Company's Standards of Engagement.
The efforts that we have undertaken to verify the absence of forced labor and child labor in our supply chain include the following:
1. Verification - Factories that are added to our sourcing base must pass a human rights factory evaluation performed by our internal audit team, our agents audit team or third party auditors. Existing factories are then audited based on the amount of business with the Company and perceived risk based on previous audit findings and internal risk ratings for the country of manufacture, taking guidance from information provided by the U.S. State Department and U.S. Department of Labor on the topics of forced labor and human trafficking.
2. Supplier Audits - Since 1994, the Company has distributed its Workplace Standards of Engagement to direct suppliers. Direct suppliers are required to post these standards in the workers' native language at their factory sites. Factory audits are conducted using internal and independent monitors. In most cases, unannounced audits are also conducted to evaluate our supplier’s compliance with the Company’s forced labor and child labor standards. For more information on our auditing and monitoring protocols, please refer to the ""Auditing and Monitoring"" section on our website.
3. Certification - The Company's Supplier Agreements require suppliers to comply with applicable laws within the country of manufacture which includes laws on slavery and human trafficking. To highlight the concern for forced labor and human trafficking, the Company has sent to its direct finished goods suppliers educational information  along with an affidavit for suppliers to attest that they will 1) review the laws related to the topic for all jurisdictions where our product are manufactured  2) routinely assess the risks within their supply chain  3) remediate any instances that may be found and take steps to prevent a reoccurrence        4) be prepared to demonstrate to our auditors that they have taken these steps. In addition, our suppliers must provide records that are sufficiently detailed to demonstrate that production is in compliance with the anti-slavery and human trafficking laws of the country, where they are manufacturing, to our company auditors upon request. Such records may include  a) all employee personnel files, including registration forms, photocopies of ID cards and training records b) all employee time cards and payroll records c) all employee employment contracts d) health & safety policies and procedures e) child labor policy and procedure f) grievance policy, procedures, records, etc.
4. Accountability To Our Standards - We are aware that suppliers may not fully comply with our Standards at all times. However management must be willing to commit to improving in areas where we have found non compliance. If we see that improvements are being made, we generally continue to work with the supplier. If suppliers are not responsive, we will deactivate the supplier code, thereby restricting future business.
5. Training – Training on the Company’s Global Code of Conduct has been provided to our agent, sourcing teams and suppliers throughout the year with the objective of raising awareness on forced labor, child labor and mitigating risk within the supply chain. In addition, training focusing specifically on the signs of forced labor and human trafficking has been provided to all internal sourcing managers and quality field managers as well as sourcing agent’s staff.
Kate Spade & Company continues to be committed to doing our part in the eradication of slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain.

CHILD LABOR AND FORCED LABOR
Supplier will not intentionally source materials from supply chains associated with human trafficking and will take reasonable efforts to assure that its own suppliers comply with this requirement. Supplier must comply with all applicable local laws with respect to child labor. In the absence of such laws or in the event existing laws permit the hiring of a person younger than 15 years of age, the minimum age for employment or work by Supplier will be 15 years of age or the age for completing compulsory education in that country, whichever is higher. Supplier must not use forced, bonded, involuntary, prison or indentured labor.
WAGES AND WORKING HOURS
Supplier must comply with all applicable local laws with respect to wage and hour laws, including those relating to minimum wages, overtime hours, and other elements of compensation, and will provide all legally mandated benefits. Supplier will not require employees to work more than the maximum number of hours permitted under applicable laws.
FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION
Supplier must respect workers’ rights to associate freely, in compliance with existing local laws and without intimidation, reprisal or harassment. Workers’ rights under local laws to join labor unions, seek representation and/or join worker’s councils should be acknowledged by Supplier.
DISCRIMINATION
Supplier must not discriminate against any worker in its hiring and employment practices based on race, color, religion, disability, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, age or other characteristic protected by local law. Supplier must not discriminate against any worker based on political affiliation or union membership in its hiring and employment practices. Supplier will not require a pregnancy test prior to employment or otherwise require workers or potential workers to undergo medical tests that could be used in a discriminatory way, except where required by applicable laws, or where prudent for workplace safety.
FAIR TREATMENT
Supplier will treat its workers with dignity and respect. Supplier will maintain a workplace free of harassment and discrimination and shall not threaten workers or subject them to harsh or inhumane treatment, including sexual harassment, sexual abuse, corporal punishment, mental or physical coercion or verbal abuse.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
Supplier will conduct its operations in compliance with applicable health and safety laws and regulations and provide its workers with a safe and healthy work environment. Where Supplier also provides accommodations for its workers, such accommodations shall be appropriate for its location and be clean, safe and, at a minimum, meet the basic needs of its workers.
ENVIRONMENT
Supplier will comply with all applicable environmental laws, regulations and standards and minimize any adverse impact on the environment. Supplier must endeavor to conserve natural resources and energy, and reduce or eliminate waste and the use of hazardous substances.
CONFLICT MINERALS
Supplier will cooperate in due diligence requests made by Dover with respect to the origin of intermediaries associated with the purchases of materials or products containing Conflict Minerals, whether or not those materials or products may have been mined or produced in the Covered Countries or obtained from recycled sources, in compliance with Dover’s reporting requirements under the US Dodd-Frank Section 1502. Where specified in a purchase order or supply agreement, Supplier will comply with any Dover requirement to provide products, components, parts and materials which are free of Conflict Minerals mined or produced in the Covered Countries in support of armed conflict in the region.
“Conflict Minerals” are tin (Cassiterite), tungsten (Wolframite), tantalum (Columbite-tantalite or coltan) and gold, and the derivative metals from these minerals.
The “Covered Countries” are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, The Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.
FAIR DEALING AND COMPETITION LAWS
Supplier will not engage in collusive bidding, price fixing, price discrimination or other unfair trade practices in violation of applicable antitrust or competition laws. Supplier will uphold fair business standards in advertising, sales and competition.
PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Supplier must respect intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and process designs, and safeguard Dover’s confidential and proprietary information. Any transfer or sharing of technology or know-how must be done in a manner that protects intellectual property rights and is in compliance with local laws, including export laws, concerning data privacy and security.
DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY
Supplier will comply with all local laws concerning data security and privacy, and will protect and safeguard data provided by Dover, which may include private and sensitive personal information. Any transfer or sharing of data must be done in a manner that protects such information from inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure and any disclosure must be in compliance with local laws.
IMPROPER PAYMENTS
Supplier is prohibited from engaging in any corruption, extortion or embezzlement, in any form. Supplier must comply with all applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations of the countries in which they operate, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Anti-Bribery Act, the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention and any international anti-corruption conventions. Supplier will not offer or accept bribes or employ other means to obtain an undue or improper advantage. Bribes, kickbacks, facilitating payments and similar payments to government officials or to Dover employees or agents acting on Dover’s behalf are prohibited. Dover employees are discouraged from accepting gifts or entertainment from suppliers, including gifts or entertainment of nominal value. When business meals are appropriate to further business relationships, those meals may not be extravagant in nature.
Each Dover business is required to maintain a register of gifts and hospitality received and offered.
MONITORING AND RECORD KEEPING
Supplier must maintain all documentation necessary to demonstrate its compliance with this Supplier Code and provide Dover with access to those documents upon Dover’s request for review. Neither Dover nor any of its affiliates or authorized agents assumes any obligation or duty to monitor or ensure compliance with this Supplier Code. Supplier is solely responsible for compliance with this Supplier Code by its officers, directors, managers, employees, representatives and agents.
VIOLATION OF THIS SUPPLIER CODE
If a Supplier violates any of the requirements contained in this Supplier Code, Dover may immediately terminate its supply relationship with that Supplier. Violations of this Supplier Code should be reported to one of the following two confidential options:

Dover Supplier Code of Conduct v. 1/2014
 
Transparency in Supply Chains Disclosure
At Hillphoenix, Inc., a subsidiary of Dover Corporation (“Dover”), we are strongly opposed to the use of forced, bonded, involuntary, prison or indentured labor. At Hillphoenix, Inc., we are constantly evaluating our supply chain to assess various compliance risks, including those related to slavery and human trafficking. The following information describes our company’s efforts to date and our future plans to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our supply chain:
As a supplement to our ongoing compliance training programs, we will, beginning in 2012, implement training for our supply chain personnel focusing specifically on slavery and human trafficking issues and ways to mitigate, to the greatest extent possible, these elements from our supply chain.
We are educating our suppliers and adopted the Dover Supplier Code of Conduct, which addresses our commitment to seek out business partners who share our values and specifically prohibits our suppliers from using forced, bonded, involuntary, prison, or indentured labor.
Dover’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires our employees to comply with employment-related laws, including those related to wages, hours, and minimum age requirements. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and our use of the Supplier Code of Conduct are important steps in gaining supplier compliance.
We take violations of our Codes very seriously. For example, violations of the Supplier Code may result in termination of the supplier relationship, while violations of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics may result in termination of employment.
While we are not currently verifying, auditing or requiring our suppliers to certify that their products and services comply with local laws regarding slavery and human trafficking, we will continue to assess our supply chain for areas of improvement in eradicating slavery and human trafficking, and will continue to expect our suppliers and employees to do the same.
 
Conflict Minerals Policy
Dover Corporation and its Operating Companies (“Hillphoenix, Inc.”) are committed to sourcing components and materials from companies that share our values regarding human rights and social responsibility.
Dover intends to comply with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Act”), which aims to prevent the use of Conflict Minerals that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or an adjoining country as defined in the Act. “Conflict Minerals” include: columbite-tantalite (coltan) (i.e., tantalum), cassiterite (i.e., tin), gold, wolframite (i.e., tungsten) or their derivatives. The Act requires Dover to perform due diligence with respect to the sourcing of Conflict Minerals and to report annually on its use of Conflict Minerals and origin of such minerals.
Dover suppliers are required to comply with Dover’s Supplier Code of Conduct, which includes requirements relating to Conflict Minerals and responsible sourcing. Relevant suppliers are responsible for passing these same requirements on to their suppliers. We expect our suppliers to implement a process to reasonably assure that the Conflict Minerals contained in the products provided to Dover do not perpetrate human rights abuses in the DRC or an adjoining country.

Transparency in Supply Chains
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (Cal. Civ. Code 1714.43 and Cal. Rev. Tax Code 19547.5) was designed to ensure that manufacturers and large retailers provide consumers with information regarding their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains, to educate consumers on how to purchase goods produced by companies that responsibly manage their supply chains, and thereby, to improve the lives of victims of slavery and human trafficking.
Slavery and human trafficking are issues that TOMS has always taken very seriously; we have a zero-tolerance policy towards these issues, as further described below. Our global supply chain staff actively manage and oversee our supply chain to ensure that our corporate responsibility standards are upheld.
TOMS therefore makes the following disclosures pursuant to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act:
TOMS is committed to fair labor practices within our supply chain. While we do not implement a formal process to verify the entities in our supply chain, TOMS does require that all of its manufacturers and material suppliers certify that they will comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct, which prohibits slavery and human trafficking.
TOMS conducts annual audits of its manufacturers and material suppliers via a third-party independent auditor. All audits are conducted during a two-week window of which the manufacturer and material supplier are advised, though the manufacturer and material supplier do not know the precise date on which the audit will occur during that two-week window. TOMS also conducts internal audits from time to time. Corrective action plans are created after each audit, whether independent or internal, and follow-up visits are conducted to monitor and ensure that corrective actions are taken. Evidence of slavery or human trafficking is a zero-tolerance violation, and TOMS would immediately move to terminate a manufacturer or material supplier if such evidence was found.
TOMS requires its manufacturers and suppliers to certify that they, and any third parties from whom they purchase materials, will comply with all applicable labor regulations in the country in which they operate, as well as with TOMS' Supplier Code of Conduct and TOMS’ Code of Business Practices.
TOMS has put in place a Code of Business Practices that it expects all employees and contractors to comply with and which prohibits working with any suppliers that use any form of forced or trafficked labor, including slavery and human trafficking. Employees and contractors are asked to report any violation of this Code of Business Practices to TOMS’ Legal Department, which will then investigate and take any and all appropriate and necessary steps.
Although TOMS does not currently provide specialized training on slavery and human trafficking to its supply chain staff, we require that all employees comply with our policies, including our Code of Business Practices which mandates the prevention of slavery and human trafficking within our supply chain.

California Supply Chain Transparency Act Disclosure
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires large manufacturers and retailers doing business in the State of California to disclose efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains.
Essentia Protein Solutions (the “Company”) is committed to ensuring that our supply chain reflects our respect for human rights.  We fully support efforts to combat, prohibit, and prevent human trafficking and slavery.  In support of this philosophy and in compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657), the Company states as follows:
1. Verification.  The Company conducts periodic evaluations of its supply chain.  Large suppliers in the US, Europe and other developed countries are considered to be low risk for violating slavery and human trafficking laws.  The Company has not employed a third party for verification. 
2. Audit.  The Company expects all suppliers to follow all applicable laws in the jurisdictions where they do business and we depend on our suppliers to audit their businesses for compliance.  Because of the overall low risk in the supply chain of the entities under our control, we do not currently audit suppliers for compliance.
3. Certification.  The Company does not require suppliers to certify that products are made in compliance with the laws regarding human trafficking and slavery of the countries in which they are doing business; however, we will consider this option if it is determined a vendor is considered to be high risk.  If we suspect a supplier is involved in these activities, we will conduct an inquiry and take corrective action where appropriate.
4. Accountability.  Company employees managing procurement and supply chain matters are required to seek agreement from relevant suppliers regarding the supplier’s compliance with applicable laws.
5. Training.  The Company provides training to all supply chain personnel regarding their role in preventing human trafficking and slavery as well as identification of risk.

Georgia-Pacific Consumer Operations LLC,"Verification
At Georgia-Pacific, we recognize the critical role we play in making products that improve lives and offer better solutions than other alternatives. Doing so sustainably requires that we balance the social, environmental and economic benefits and risks of our products, including how they are sourced, manufactured and used. Suppliers play a key role in our efforts to ensure that we manage our global supply chain in a sustainable way.
Direct Supplier Certification
Georgia-Pacific's commitment to ensuring that its supply chain is maintained in a socially responsible way includes, an expectation that suppliers not use forced labor in any of its forms, including human trafficking and slavery, to produce the products they provide to Georgia-Pacific.  These expectations are set out in the Georgia-Pacific Code of Conduct and the  Georgia-Pacific Supplier Sustainability Guidelines.   In addition, contracts with our suppliers obligate them to produce the products that we buy in a way that complies with applicable laws and regulations; at this time, however, Georgia-Pacific does not require suppliers to certify that they are in compliance.
Supplier Audits and Accountability Standards
To monitor compliance with the expectations of the Georgia-Pacific Supplier Sustainability Guidelines, Georgia-Pacific itself, instead of a third party vendor, assesses a number of its more than 30,000 suppliers. On an annual basis, suppliers are selected using a risk-based approach; supplier participation in this process is mandatory.
The three-stage assessment process includes a review of supplier responses to a detailed request for information. If during this review, Georgia-Pacific identifies any concerns or supplier responses require clarification, the supplier is moved into stage two, which includes a conference call or other meeting with that supplier to address the concern or clarification. If the issue cannot be resolved at this stage, the supplier is moved to stage three, which may include a supplier site audit. Depending on the nature of the concerns involved, these site audits may be unannounced. Failure to meet the Georgia-Pacific Supplier Sustainability Guidelines may result in discontinuation of the supplier relationship.
Training on Human Trafficking and Slavery
Since implementing this assessment process, Georgia-Pacific has educated its procurement organization and others in the organization on this process and the Supplier Sustainability Guidelines. Further educational efforts regarding these expectations may include face-to-face meetings, web-based seminars and computer-based training, and will focus on how employees can assist Georgia-Pacific in mitigating risks within its supply chain.

Mettler-Toledo,"Information re: Transparency in Supply Chain Act                          METTLER TOLEDO
METTLER TOLEDO abides by all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Recently, the State
of California enacted the Transparency in Supply Chains Act. The following information
sets forth the actions METTLER TOLEDO is taking to uphold human rights in its Supply
Chain.
METTLER TOLEDO abides by the principles of ethical behavior as set forth in its Code of
Conduct for all employees (see www.mt.com/sustainability). In addition, METTLER
TOLEDO’s Business Partner Code of Conduct details METTLER TOLEDO’s commitment to
conduct its business ethically, legally and in a socially responsible manner with regard to all
of its business relationships. We expect the same commitment from our business partners,
including those in our Supply Chain.
The METTLER TOLEDO Business Partner Code of Conduct requires that each of our
business partners commit to the creation of safe working conditions and a healthy work
environment for all of their workers (see www.mt.com/businesspartner). Specifically,
METTLER TOLEDO’s Business Partner Code of Conduct requires that our business partners
be committed to uphold the human rights of workers and employ them according to working
laws and regulations. We require our business partners to create and maintain an
environment where all of their employees are treated with dignity and respect. Further, our
business partners must provide a work environment free from coercion and harassment. Our
business partners cannot use child labor, or forced, indentured or involuntary labor, and
illegal human trade or trafficking for commercial exploitation is forbidden. Our business
partners must also commit to a workforce free of discrimination in hiring and employment
practices.
METTLER TOLEDO’s Ethical, Social and Quality Standards further establish our strong
commitment in the area of human rights. Specifically, these Ethical, Social and Quality
Standards set forth METTLER TOLEDO’s support and respect of universal human rights,
particularly of its workers, business partners and the communities within which it operates.
These Ethical, Social and Quality Standards can be accessed via our Business Partner
Portal (www.mt.com/businesspartner).
METTLER TOLEDO’s Global Terms and Conditions of Purchase contain a provision
requiring Suppliers to comply with all laws, regulations and standards and further establish
METTLER TOLEDO’s right to conduct Supplier audits (see www.mt.com/supplierportal).
These Global Terms and Conditions of Purchase, which are referenced on all purchase
orders issued by our facilities throughout the world, also require Suppliers to comply with the
METTLER TOLEDO Business Partner Code of Conduct. Additionally, more detailed
requirements and analysis on this topic are conducted with select Suppliers via master
purchase agreements and on-site process audits.

California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010
Corporate Disclosure
Throughout the history of Trinity Industries, Inc. (""we,"" ""us“ and our “Company”), we have built a
reputation of honesty, trust and integrity by being committed to the highest ethical standards,
which we base on our Core Values that are vital to our reputation and success. Because our
business success is closely related to our reputation, it is up to us to protect that reputation. Our
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (our “Code”) and Core Values can be viewed on the
Investor Relations Section of our Website.
Under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (the ""Act""), we are required to
disclose certain efforts we take to help eradicate slavery and human trafficking in our direct
supply chain for the products that we sell. We are subject to the Act because we do business in
California and meet certain revenue requirements specified in the Act. However, we believe that
the nature of our business, products, and suppliers present minimal risk of slavery and human
trafficking in our supply chain.
We are committed to compliance with all governmental laws, rules and regulations applicable to
our operations, including, but not limited to, fair employment practices and compliance with
equal employment opportunity, safe and healthful work environment, equitable treatment of
employees, and all other employment laws in the United States and other countries where we
manufacture our products or source products through our supply chain. We expect all
employees and suppliers to conduct themselves in compliance therewith. Employees are to
avoid any activity that could lead to our Company’s involvement, or the involvement of our
assets or personnel, in any unlawful practice. Slavery and human trafficking are illegal and not
permitted by our Code.
Our employees, including those involved in our supply chain, are held to the high standards
required by our Code. We require select employees and contractors to participate in training
on, and to verify compliance with, our Code each year. Further, we are currently considering
options for trafficking- and slavery-specific training with online modules.
While we perform periodic audits of supplier compliance with our agreements, these audits do
not presently include audits or written certifications of legal compliance specifically regarding
human trafficking and slavery. We are investigating, through our Manufacturing Center of

Knoll and Sustainable Design
Sustainability is a process that embodies a vision for the future. It is measured by what is sometimes called “the triple bottom line”—the social, economic and environmental outcomes of business on people, economic competitiveness and the natural world.
 
Climate Change
We work on meaningful approaches to conserve energy, promote the use of renewable energy sources and divert waste from landfill. Through our Energy Management Program we have established an energy baseline for manufacturing processes; energy conservation techniques; a framework for evaluating energy reduction opportunities; guidelines for capital investments in energy projects; energy pricing and supply risk reduction protocols; programs to increase energy efficiency in Knoll products; and a transportation energy reduction program.
Our investment since 2004 in energy efficiency initiatives and infrastructure has topped $3.0 million. Following our success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions at our manufacturing facilities, exceeding our goal by 23%, we have redefined our carbon reduction strategy and joined the Carbon Disclosure Project, which commits to further reductions and public disclosure.
Climate Change Continued
Our carbon disclosure reduction strategy focuses on many elements: product design in tandem with lifecycle assessment (LCA) methodology to aid in the selection of materials; facilities design with concert with LEED® guidelines in constructing, renovating and retrofitting facilities; and supply chain metrics for CO2 reduction against processing steel, processing wood and assembling products.
Energy conservation and recovery programs complement these activities. These conservation initiatives include lighting upgrades, lighting controls and process/equipment improvements. On the production end, we achieve energy recovery by diverting organic waste, primarily wood, that is not recyclable from landfill to energy-from-waste facilities.
Third Party Certification
We have been an industry pioneer in advocating and submitting our products for independent third party certification. We believe that respected third parties provide the most impartial and trustworthy foundation for broad compliance.
Our partner programs include: USGBC (US Green Building Council): LEED (Leadership in Environmental Design); FSC® (Forest Stewardship Council); SMaRT© (Sustainable Materials Rating Technology) from MTS (Market Transformation to Sustainability); level® certification, a BIFMA (the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer’s Association) program certified by Scientific Certification Systems (SCS);ISO 14001 (International Organization for Standardization); and OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration).
Knoll and level®
The level standard is a voluntary product standard developed by BIFMA, the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer’s Association, to support safe, healthy and sustainable workplace environments. The program establishes prerequisites, requires third party certification including audits of manufacturing plants and mandates annual reviews to maintain certifications. Certification is awarded at three levels: Entry level 1 (32-44 points); level 2 (45-62 points) and level 3 (63 -90 points).
We submit our products for level 3 certification, the highest rating, and we are proud that we have achieved level 3 certification for all of our principal workplace product lines.
Open Plan and Private Office Furniture: Antenna Workspaces, AutoStrada, Dividends Horizon, Equity, Morrison, Reff Profiles
Seating: Chadwick, Generation by Knoll, Life, Moment, ReGeneration by Knoll, MultiGeneration by Knoll
Knoll and FSC®
The Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC) is the international standard setting organization for defining and measuring a well-managed forest and providing traceability though a chain of custody certification. Knoll FSC certification (FSC® C028824) ensures that Knoll products bearing the FSC mark are manufactured with wood from forests that protect environmental, social and economic values. FSC principles represent the industry’s most rigorous standards of forest stewardship.
Our FSC Certified Standard Program covers all general office plan open systems, casegoods and tables, with the exception of certain products from the KnollStudio Collection. The standard applies to the core of all Knoll products with laminate and domestic cherry, maple, oak and walnut.
Knoll and SMaRT©
SMaRT (Sustainable Materials Rating Technology) from MTS (Market Transformation to Sustainability) is a comprehensive sustainability standard covering areas. The standard encompasses Public Health and Environment; Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency; Bio-based or Recycled Materials and Innovations in Manufacturing.
Knoll has achieved SMaRT certifications for the Generation family of chairs; Chadwick, Life and Moment chairs as well as Calibre storage and Template workplace furniture.
Knoll and Full Circle®
Full Circle is an exclusive resource recovery program developed with ANEW, a non-profit organization dedicated to extending the life cycle of surplus furniture, fixtures and equipment (FF&E), architectural materials, and building assets in an economically, socially and environmentally responsible way.
We have completed 36 Full Circle projects, diverting over 1700 tons of used furniture and other items from landfill through matches to community charities, recycling and energy from-waste. Projects range from a major financial institution, to a large beverage company, to a major utility company,as well as universities and municipalities.
 
Design for the Environment
In everything we design and manufacture, we focus on environmentally responsible materials, products and – and we build the infrastructure to strategically support sustainability in all aspects of our operation.
Our product design and development activities are governed by Knoll Design for the Environment (DFE) policies and procedures, including a Product Commercialization process in which stringent SMaRT criteria are embedded. DFE requires a product to meet target environmental standards relating to materials, material content and production processes. Additionally, documentation is required for materials on post-consumer and post-industrial recycled contents.
All Knoll products undergo Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) during design and development to measure potential environmental impacts. We structure our LCA process in three phases: Cradle-to-Gate, which looks at supply chain inputs; Gate-to-Gate, which looks at our wood, metal and assembly processes; and Gate-to-Grave, which looks at what happened to a product at the end of its useful life.

"Orbital Sciences Corporation, Orbital ATK, Inc.","Becoming a Supplier
Orbital ATK partners with suppliers with proven capabilities and commitment to mutually agreed technical, quality, cost, schedule,  and contractual requirements. Our Supply Chain Management Organization is chartered with finding suppliers where there is a mutual benefit for products and technologies.  To become a supplier requires a sound value proposition, compliance with federal contracting requirements if applicable, a documented quality management system, and proven capabilities.
Doing Business with Orbital ATK
We believe strongly that critical processes and product characteristics must be controlled statistically so that we can produce repeatable products and systems that consistently meet or exceed requirements at reduced cost. We expect our suppliers to contribute to this commitment by practicing lean six sigma continual improvement philosophies that enable both Orbital ATK and our suppliers to continually improve our quality, schedule, and costs. It is not hard to understand why late deliveries or products that fail to meet Orbital ATK quality requirements result in higher costs; not only to Orbital ATK and our customers, but also our suppliers. Late deliveries result in extra expense to the supplier for rework product and expedited costs for both companies. Most importantly, late deliveries may result in lost revenues to our customers, and potential loss of business for Orbital ATK, and ultimately, our suppliers. The goal is simple: provide solutions to our customers which result in the lowest total lifecycle cost.
Ethics and Business Conduct
We are committed to conducting business in an ethical manner and we expect our suppliers to have the same level of commitment.  Orbital ATK holds itself to the highest ethical standards and takes pride in a reputation of trust, integrity, and accountability among key stakeholders—employees, suppliers, agents, customers, and shareholders—and we use our  Code of Ethics and  Business Conduct, to outline and reinforce our commitment to ethical behavior at every level. We require each and every employee to read, understand, and abide by our Code of Conduct. We also strive to develop partnerships with suppliers that agree to adhere to the elements of our code of conduct that support our employees' efforts.
The overarching principles that drive Orbital ATK's supply chain are:
business conduct at our suppliers that is consistent with Orbital ATK's values;
the protection of the confidentiality of Orbital ATK's proprietary information;
the advance notification of discontinuous supply from our suppliers and from their sub tier suppliers; and
environmental awareness that surpasses US, state and local regulatory requirements.
Terms & Conditions
Working together, we can improve today's performance and gain a competitive advantage for tomorrow's business. It's a winning combination. One way that we can improve today's performance is through efficient exchange of information and tools, such as forms, procedures, quality assurance provisions, terms and conditions, and other Orbital ATK documentation.
Effective November 16, 2015, Orbital ATK has consolidated to a standard set of Procurement Terms and Conditions that apply for all purchase orders and RFQ’s.
Quality Requirements
We expect our suppliers to build in quality through rigorous analytical, design and production processes. Suppliers' quality systems must stress defect prevention rather than defect detection. Historical data shows that the long-term cost for defect prevention is far lower than detection events that occur later in the value stream. Orbital ATK's products and systems have a reputation for being affordable and reliable, due in part to our rigorous efforts at continuous improvement. We expect suppliers to impose these same high standards to their products as well.
Performance
Orbital ATK has established a Supplier Performance Management Program (SPMP) methodology to manage our suppliers.  Key elements of this program include:
A methodology and nomenclature for supplier segmentation
Alignment with Orbital ATK's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Program
A tiered approach to assessing suppliers based upon supplier segmentation and risk
Continuous improvement and innovation with the strategic supply base
A consistent message to suppliers regarding performance expectations and objectives
A standardized Supplier Performance Rating System (SPRS) that will serve as the foundation to measure supplier performance using three key performance indicators (KPIs):  on-time delivery, supplier quality, and supplier financial risk.
Supplier Diversity
Orbital ATK embraces supplier diversity and maintains programs to seek diverse suppliers, as well as,   nurture our relationships with those suppliers, while actively responding to the socioeconomic needs of our communities and customers. Orbital ATK actively pursues opportunities to assist diversity companies in becoming qualified so they have the ability to win business, and the potential of  becoming a long-term supplier.
Regulatory Information
FAR/DFAR
Orbital ATK is firmly committed to conducting our operations ethically and in compliance with all the laws and regulations that govern our business.  From a supply chain management perspective, compliance to public laws, FAR, DFAR, NASA and other federal agency acquisition regulations is imperative for both our company and our supplies and includes all aspects of supply chain management including procurement, subcontracting, government property management, and material management and accounting.  Successful compliance requires the implementation of a comprehensive management control system and adherence to established best practices.
Conflict Minerals
Orbital ATK's Conflict Minerals Policy provides that Orbital ATK conducts its business activities in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and allocates adequate resources to ensure compliance to this SEC requirement. It is Orbital ATK's policy to perform reasonable due diligence in the sourcing of Conflict Minerals and we expect Orbital ATK's suppliers and subcontractors to exercise reasonable due diligence on the source and chain of custody of minerals used in the manufacturing of their products and to make their due diligence measures available to Orbital ATK upon request.
Consistent with this policy, Orbital ATK:
Implemented and maintains a due diligence framework to identify and trace Conflict Minerals in Orbital ATK's supply chain;
Uses an industry standardized reporting template for completion by applicable suppliers and subcontractors; and
Maintains reviewable business records supporting the source of Conflict Minerals.
For more information on conflict minerals, please refer to the Orbital ATK SEC filings on this subject.

"
Bayer Corporation,"Welcome to the Bayer U.S. news section. Here you will find our news wire, other Bayer news, statements, images and video, leadership biographies, fact sheets, and our list of media contacts.
California Transparency in Supply Chains Act
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 is designed to increase the amount of information made available by manufacturers and retailers regarding their efforts (if any) to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking, thereby allowing consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support. The following highlights Bayer’s global efforts in this regard.
Bayer supports the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and a number of globally recognized declarations for multinational enterprises. As a founding member of the United Nations Global Compact initiative, Bayer undertakes to implement the 10 universally recognized principles in the areas of human rights, labor standards, environmental protection and anti-corruption throughout the organization when shaping business processes and strategies.
Promoting human rights standards internally and throughout all of Bayer’s business operations is in line with our Values and Leadership Principles , our Sustainable Development Policy and our group-wide Human Rights Position . Bayer’s commitment to foster the implementation of human rights is supported through our Corporate Compliance Policy . It is in effect at all Bayer locations, and it applies to Bayer’s business operations worldwide. Bayer will use this position as a framework to guide our decision-making and constructive engagement within our sphere of influence, while the responsibility of the governments of the various countries for protection of human rights is respected.
Bayer has combined all of its fundamental sustainability standards and requirements for its suppliers in a Supplier Code of Conduct . This code of conduct comprises the areas of ethics, labor, management systems, health, safety, environment, and quality. Our Supplier Code of Conduct emphasizes international labor and human rights standards. Suppliers are expected to protect the human rights of their employees and to treat them with dignity and respect. Supplier employees shall have the right to freely choose employment, the right to associate freely and join or be represented by worker councils or labor unions on a voluntary basis, and the right to bargain collectively as they choose. Workers also have the right to a workplace free of harassment and unlawful discrimination.
In order to successfully address the diverse challenges of a sustainable supply chain and to leverage synergies together with other companies, we collaborate with the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) as well as with Together for Sustainability (TfS), an initiative co-founded by Bayer. In both initiatives, we focus on the standardization of sustainability aspects in the relevant industries in order to establish corresponding social, ethical and environmental practices among our suppliers. The exchange of supplier assessments and audits among member companies enables access to additional sustainability evaluations of suppliers who also work for Bayer. This minimizes the administrative burden for both suppliers and the member companies.
The Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative is a group of major pharmaceutical companies who share a vision of better social, economic, and environmental outcomes for all those involved in the pharmaceutical supply chain. This includes improved conditions for workers (including freely chosen employment, no involuntary prison labor, abolition of child labor, and no use of forced, bonded or indentured labor), economic development, and a cleaner environment for local communities.
The Together for Sustainability initiative is a group of multinational companies which aims at developing and implementing a global supplier engagement program that assesses and improves sustainability sourcing practices, including ecological and social aspects.  The initiative is based on good practices and builds on established principles – such as the United Nations Global Compact and the Responsible Care Global Charter as well as standards developed by the International Labour Organization (ILO), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Social Accountability International (SAI) and others.
Slavery and human trafficking can take many forms, including forced labor and child labor. We follow a clear 'zero tolerance to child labor' policy in our business operations worldwide. We do not tolerate child labor in our supply chain either, where we take action against known cases of violations. Our efforts to fight against child labor and forced labor are consistent with the ILO’s core labor standards and the United Nations Global Compact principles.
Our efforts for more sustainability in the supply chain include:
Sustainability standards: Bayer regards adherence to sustainability standards within the supply chain as a crucial factor in the value chain. By acting responsibly in collaboration with our suppliers, we aim to minimize risks and create stable, long-term business relationships with our partners. For this reason, Bayer applies not just economic standards, but also environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards in choosing new suppliers or continuing its relationships with existing ones. These standards are defined in our Supplier Code of Conduct, which includes child labor avoidance and no utilization of forced, bonded or indentured labor or involuntary prison labor. It is binding and integrated into electronic ordering systems and contracts throughout Bayer. The Supplier Code of Conduct is based on the principles of the United Nations Global Compact and our Human Rights Position.
Supplier sustainability performance evaluation: The sustainability performance of our suppliers is monitored through online supplier assessments and on-site audits. The assessments are carried out on our behalf by a leading web-based service platform for sustainability performance monitoring (EcoVadis). They are based on a web-supported, modular questionnaire completed by the supplier, coupled with accompanying verification documents and 360° screening. Suppliers are selected for these assessments based on a combination of country and material risks as well as strategic importance in accordance with our Group targets. We conduct the on-site audits with external, independent auditors. Here, too, we apply the standard of the respective industry initiatives in which we participate in order to benefit from synergies. In addition, internal auditors perform inspections focusing on health, safety, environmental protection and sustainability. All assessment and audit results are thoroughly analyzed and documented. Wherever the results are unsatisfactory, we develop improvement measures together with our suppliers to ensure that they observe social, ethical and environmental standards in the future. In 2015, 6% of the evaluations had a critical result. These suppliers were requested by Bayer to rectify the identified weaknesses with the help of corrective instructions or action plans. In 2015, Bayer was not prompted to end a supplier relationship due solely to sustainability performance or serious sustainability deficiencies.
Training for procurement staff: We offer training activities to help procurement staff worldwide create awareness of sustainability and possible risks in dialogue with our suppliers. Training for procurement employees includes online courses dealing with the EcoVadis sustainability assessment process. In addition, we organize specific training events, such as courses for selected procurement employees on the issue of sustainability audits or sustainability roadshows for different procurement categories and local procurement organizations.
Training for suppliers: We regularly provide information on sustainability to our suppliers through Supplier Days. This global and local dialogue is essential to build up reliable relations and to make the principles of our procurement policy and our sustainability requirements clear to our suppliers. In return, we would like to know more about the suppliers’ situation in order to be able to identify and remove obstacles in our collaboration at an early stage. The continuous development of suppliers in terms of sustainability is also a key objective of the industry initiatives TfS and PSCI. The TfS initiative offers online sustainability training to provide suppliers with general information on the initiative and the audit process. Moreover, the TfS member companies organize joint supplier events with the aim to promote a mutual understanding on sustainability challenges and requirements in the supply chain. PSCI likewise promotes continuing supplier development by means of the comprehensive information provided on the PSCI website, and by organizing webinars and conferences on subjects such as occupational safety.

WellPet has a Vendor Assurance Program that requires suppliers to agree to facility audits.                                          We only partner with suppliers who share our passion for bringing the highest quality pet food                                         to pet parents. WellPet has conducted general, announced audits of certain of its suppliers,                                         and has not observed violations with respect to human trafficking or slavery issues.                                         WellPet currently is evaluating what actions it might take in addition to those described                                         above to further verify that trafficking and slavery play no role in producing materials                                          used in WellPet products.  This ongoing evaluation is specifically examining possible independent,                                         unannounced audits relating to trafficking and slavery.   WellPet has not adopted any formal procedures                                         to address labor violations in its supply chain.  WellPet has recently adopted a requirement that at                                         least two of its employees with the most direct responsibility for supply chain management will                                          undergo training on maintaining a supply chain that avoids problems associated with human trafficking and slavery.
WellPet welcomes questions and comments concerning its efforts to avoid slavery and human trafficking in the supply chain for its products.                                         We believe in openness with pet parents and the pets that depend on us for their wellbeing.

Swatfame Inc.,"Disclosure Statement Pursuant to California Transparency in Supply chains Act of 2010
Swat Fame is committed to the highest standards of social responsibility.  As part of this commitment we are obligated to ensure our products are produced in an ethical and legal manner.  Swat Fame takes seriously the federal and international efforts to end human trafficking and slavery, and we strive to ensure that our suppliers do not engage in such unlawful practices.
Supply Chain Verification and Audits
Swat Fame’s policy is to evaluate potential contracted factories before they enter the supply chain to assess compliance with standards including country-related risk for issues including human trafficking and slavery.  Swat Fame has previously commissioned external third party audits. Prior to partnering with any new suppliers, and annually thereafter, we conduct a screening of these suppliers, taking into account their geographic location, workforce profile and history of human trafficking and slavery in the sector.  If a supplier is suspected or found to be in violation of such policies, the relationship is discontinued until such time as Swat Fame has verified that any potential or actual non-compliance issues have been resolved.  Our employees have also conducted announced visits to a majority of the suppliers identified to be at risk based on the criteria provided above.
Supply Chain Certification
To ensure that our contractors and suppliers respect and enforce our company standards, we include a clause in our supplier agreements governing our contractual relationships with our suppliers requiring each of our suppliers must abide by our anti-slavery and human trafficking standards.  Thus as a condition of doing business with us, and as a means of self-certification, the supplier agreement clause provides that each supplier represents that it complies with all applicable local and international laws and regulations regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.

"Just Born, Inc.","Disclosure
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires companies manufacturing or selling products in the State of California to disclose what efforts they are taking to eradicate slavery, forced labor, and human trafficking from their direct supply chains for tangible goods they offer for sale. The law’s underlying purpose is to educate consumers so that they can make informed decisions and purchase goods from companies that responsibly manage their supply chain. 
Slavery, forced labor, and human trafficking can take many forms, including child labor. Just Born has a zero-tolerance policy for any forced or compulsory labor, including slavery and human trafficking, used in the manufacture of all products that it sells. Just Born’s efforts to eradicate slavery, forced labor, and human trafficking from its supply chain include the following:
Verification: Just Born self-verifies its product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. Just Born has not found it necessary for these verifications to be conducted by a third party because it is confident that human trafficking and slavery is not a part of its supply chain.
Auditing: Just Born currently conducts periodic onsite audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with its standards regarding human trafficking and slavery in its supply chain. Audits conducted by Just Born are typically pre-coordinated audits, but in some cases audits may be unannounced.
Certification: Just Born standard purchase terms and conditions requires its direct suppliers to certify that materials, goods, and services they furnished to Just Born comply with federal, state, and local laws, which include laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the country or countries in which they are doing business. Suppliers must certify that they are not consciously engaging in practices such as:
Child labor
Forced labor/Human trafficking (in all its forms)
Health and Safety conditions posing immediate risk to life or limb
Internal Accountability: Just Born maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet its standards regarding slavery and trafficking. Our company requires key suppliers to agree and sign a Vendor Guidelines and Compliance Agreement as part of entering into a business transaction. Non-compliance with our agreement will result in termination of the business relationship.

National Steel and Shipbuilding Company DBA NASSCO,"California Transparency in Supply ChainS Act
NASSCO complies with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (Cal. Civ. Code § 1714.43) (“the Act”) by doing the following.
Verification.  In connection with NASSCO’s supplier qualification list (QSL) process, NASSCO requires all prospective suppliers to complete a questionnaire and provide information about their business practices so that NASSCO can assess the supplier’s compliance in general.  NASSCO only does business with suppliers who successfully complete the QSL process.  The verification process is performed by NASSCO and not performed by a third party.
Audits.  NASSCO reserves the right to audit a supplier's compliance with NASSCO’s terms and conditions and the QSL process.  Such audits would only be conducted if there was reason to believe that a supplier was not in compliance with NASSCO's standards against trafficking and slavery in supply chains.
Certifications.  NASSCO’s supply chain management process was recently updated to obtain a signed certification from each supplier before the supplier can be added to NASSCO’s QSL.  The certification states that the supplier represents and warrants that it is compliance with the Act and federal human trafficking regulations aimed to stop human trafficking. Additionally, NASSCO’s purchase orders also bear a standard pre-printed note that states “By accepting this PO, Seller certifies that it is in compliance with FAR 52.222-50, DFARS 252.222-7007 and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (Cal. Civ. Code § 1714.43), and that Seller does not engage in forced labor, slavery, or human trafficking.”
Accountability.  General Dynamics’ Standards of Business Ethics and Conduct (“the Blue Book”) governs NASSCO’s ethics and business standards.  The Code of Ethics includes, among other things, that our employees will comply with applicable laws and regulations.  Human trafficking and slavery are illegal, and constitute a violation of the Blue Book by our employees and suppliers.  Such a violation would result in a disciplinary action against the employee.  Any supplier found to be engaging in slavery or human trafficking will be terminated and removed from the QSL.
Training.  NASSCO provides training to its Supply Chain Representatives on the Act and federal human trafficking regulations.

"Exemplis LLC, dba SitOnIt Seating, SitOnIt, Ideon","The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires us to disclose our efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our direct supply chain. We take very seriously all efforts to end forced labor – whether in the form of prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor, human trafficking, or otherwise – and require our suppliers to maintain a strict “employment is voluntary” policy.
SUPPLY CHAIN VERIFICATION
Our policy is to evaluate potential suppliers’ factories before they enter our supply chain to assess compliance with standards including country-related risk for issues including forced labor, human trafficking and slavery. Currently we use internal auditors for this process.
SUPPLIER AUDITS
We evaluate our suppliers’ adherence to our standards through internal auditing procedures. Each year we inspect a subset of our suppliers’ factories.
DIRECT SUPPLIERS' CERTIFICATION OF MATERIALS
We are working on mapping and understanding impacts further up from our direct supply chain in order to develop standards for upstream suppliers of our direct suppliers. Our goal is to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our indirect supply chains as well.
STANDARDS FOR COMPLIANCE
If a supplier is found to violate our standards or applicable laws, it is responsible for improving performance against a corrective action plan instituted by us. If the factory fails to make progress against the plan, it is subject to review and sanctions, including termination. We think the best way to combat human trafficking and slavery is to work with the cooperation of our suppliers through the establishment of clear expectations and protocols.
TRAINING
Employees and management with direct responsibility for supply chain management are provided internal training on forced labor, including human trafficking and slavery. We also encourage our suppliers to participate in external training programs and seminars on social compliance issues.

"Kuni Enterprises, Inc. DBA Kuni Automotive","Transparency in Supply Chains Act Disclosure
On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act went into effect in the State of California.  Under the Act, certain manufacturers and retailers are required to disclose their efforts to combat human trafficking and slavery in the products within their supply chains.  The following disclosure is made in accordance with the requirements of the Act.

Ethane Export Facility
We currently are constructing the first world scale ethane export facility at our Morgan's Point terminal located on the Houston ship channel. This export facility will have a loading rate of approximately 200 thousand barrels per day (""MBPD"") across two docks and is approximately 90 percent contracted. The facility, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2016, will provide ethylene crackers and other end-use markets access to the most prolific supplies of ethane in the world.
LPG Export Facility
Enterprise has operated the LPG (propane and butane) Import and Export Terminal for over 30 years and has announced plans to further expand the export facility from a loading capacity of ~9 million barrels per month (“MMBbls/mo”) up to 16 MMBbls/mo of LPGs in the fourth quarter of 2015. More than 90% of the operating capacity is contracted through 2019, with a majority of the capacity under contract as far out as 2022. The LPG cargoes are destined for markets from the Caribbean to the Far East; and for a variety of uses including consumer needs and to satisfy petrochemical demand.
PDH Unit
We are constructing a PDH unit at Mont Belvieu which will produce 1.65 billion Lbs per year of Polymer Grade Propylene (""PGP"") or 25 MBPD. It will consume 35 MBPD of propane. This facility is 100%contracted with average 15-year fee-based contracts with investment grade companies. The unit is expected to be commissioned first quarter 2017.

6.0 RULES OF CONDUCT FOR SUPPLIERS
Elkay’s increasing global presence has resulted in growth in international sourcing. Elkay is
committed to its values and ethics in its global operations and seeks to ensure that products it sells,
including all components of those products, are produced under conditions that respect worker rights
and our environment.
While Elkay recognizes the complex issues faced in many developing countries, there are basic
standards regarding workers’ rights and protecting our environment that must be met by those
seeking to do business with Elkay as a supplier.
To ensure that the products and components that Elkay sells have been produced under conditions
that respect worker rights and the environment, Elkay requires that suppliers seeking to do business
with it evidence their commitment to these basic standards. Elkay will conduct a physical review of
each new supplier to ensure that it meets requirements with respect to applicable laws and working
conditions, including laws against human trafficking and slavery. Specifically, Elkay will not
knowingly enter into business relations with a supplier, subcontractor, or business that:
     •   Directly or indirectly uses child labor
     •   Makes use of any type of forced or involuntary labor (including slavery or human trafficking)
     •   Subjects its employees to any form of abuse, physical discipline or physical or psychological
         mistreatment
     •   Does not comply with local laws regarding hours worked, overtime, and days off
     •   Does not undertake to comply with local environmental laws
     •   Does not provide its employees with adequate safety and protective equipment.
In addition to the process for selecting new suppliers, Elkay engages in verification of the practices of
its existing supplier base through periodic audits to assess risks and ensure compliance with laws and
working conditions (noted above), including laws governing human trafficking and slavery.
Elkay will not knowingly work with suppliers that do not respect these standards and those of our
customers. We will periodically assess the supplier’s compliance with these standards. Any reported
non-compliance will be investigated and appropriate action will be taken. Elkay will attempt to work
with supplier to remedy the violation. If the effort to remedy the violation is unsuccessful, Elkay will
evaluate the business relationship and take appropriate corrective action. Corrective action may
include several actions, including cancelation of a Purchase Order up to termination of the use of a
facility or supplier. If a supplier refuses access of the facility to our auditors, the relationship with that
supplier will be terminated.
This is to confirm that I, ______________________ of _______________________ (the “Company”),
have read and understood the attached Elkay Manufacturing Company Rules of Conduct for
Suppliers and that the Company will respect the rules as identified above.
Signed at _________________________ the ______ day of ______________ 20___.

CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS DISCLOSURE
GN Netcom requires its supply chain to adhere to and reflect GN Netcom’s company values and respect for human rights.
"
ISOLA USA Corp,"On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Acts of 2010 (SB 657) (the “Act”) went into effect in the State of California. The Act seeks the elimination of forced labor, slavery and human trafficking from product supply chains and requires that companies disclose their efforts to ensure their supply chains are free from forced labor, slavery or human trafficking.
As a full member of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), we review our supply chain, our suppliers’ practices and our policies and procedures with respect to our suppliers to ensure that our direct supply chain is free from forced labor, slavery or human trafficking, including the following:
Written Policies and Procedures:  In connection with joining the EICC, Isola has adopted the EICC Code of Conduct. The EICC Code of Conduct contains internationally recognized labor and human rights standards that include, among other things, freely chosen employment, child labor avoidance, restrictions on working hours, and humane treatment of employees.  Further, the EICC Code of Conduct requires that we operate our business in compliance with all applicable labor laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to, all laws forbidding the solicitation, facilitation or any other use of slavery or human trafficking, as those terms are defined in the Act.  We have purchase agreements or purchase order terms and conditions in place requiring our suppliers to comply with international standards and applicable laws and regulations that prohibit forced labor, slavery or human trafficking.
Supplier Certifications:  In 2015, we will verify that all of our suppliers have certified their compliance with EICC Code of Conduct, including the provisions barring the use of forced labor, slavery or human trafficking.
Third-Party Audits: Shared audits of suppliers are conducted by various EICC members, including Isola, to ensure the suppliers are in compliance with the EICC Code of Conduct.  These audits specifically address compliance with all applicable labor laws, rules and regulations governing forced labor, slavery and human trafficking, as set forth in the Act. These audits are announced to suppliers in advance and are conducted in accordance with a uniform EICC audit protocol.  The EICC encourages its members to have these audits conducted by third party auditors, but EICC members may conduct these audits themselves provided that members’ internal company auditors have been specifically approved by the EICC Audit Program Manager.  It is expected that over a period of several years all of the high-risk suppliers within the EICC supply chain will be audited.
Accountability Standards:  Isola has a zero tolerance policy for violation of the laws banning forced labor, slavery or human trafficking. If we determine that a supplier violated any of these laws, we will remove the supplier from our approved vendor list.  In addition, any Isola employee who fails to alert executive management of any prohibited activities concerning slavery and trafficking by Isola suppliers will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment.
Employee Training: While personnel working in Isola’s Supply Chain management have reviewed and are familiar with this statement on supply chain responsibility, we currently do not offer formal training on this statement.We are in the process of implementing a new learning management system and plan to expand our training efforts to include supply chain training by the end of 2016.
Isola is committed to taking necessary measures to ensure our direct supply chain is free from forced labor, slavery and human trafficking. We will continue to update our policies and procedures as needed to safeguard against any mistreatment of persons involved in our direct supply chain.

"Garland Industries, Inc.","The Garland Company, Inc.
California Supply Chains Act
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (the ""Act"") was approved by the Governor of California on September 30, 2010. The Act requires that manufacturers and retailers doing business in the state of California disclose efforts to eradicate slavery, underage labor, and human trafficking from the direct supply chain.
In compliance with the Act, Garland Industries, Inc. and its affiliated companies (""Garland"") state that Garland is committed to ensuring that slavery, underage labor, and human trafficking do not exist in Garland's supply chain. Garland requires that its suppliers comply with all applicable laws including, but not limited to, laws prohibiting slavery, underage labor, and human trafficking. As Garland believes there is low risk in its supply chain for noncompliance, Garland does not currently audit its suppliers for compliance. However, Garland will consider additional measures, such as auditing suppliers, if Garland determines that any suppliers are at high risk for noncompliance. If Garland suspects a supplier is involved in slavery, underage labor, or human trafficking, Garland will order an investigation. If Garland uncovers compliance problems, Garland will provide such supplier with written notice and a specified period of time to take corrective action. In addition, Garland reserves the right to mandate that a supplier certify compliance with all such laws prior to continuing a relationship with such supplier.
Garland's employees are required to comply with all applicable laws including, but not limited to, laws regarding slavery, underage labor, and human trafficking. Garland also trains employees, that work within the Garland supply chain, on compliance with applicable laws prohibiting slavery, underage labor, and human trafficking.

PepsiCo Statement on Use of Genetically Modified Ingredients in the U.S.
Providing consumers with safe products is PepsiCo's number one priority, and we understand that some consumers have questions about genetically modified food ingredients.
The use of genetically modified (GM) ingredients is safe for people and our planet, and also has a number of important benefits.
Many of the most influential regulatory agencies and organizations that study the safety of the food supply, including the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, the American Medical Association, the World Health Organization, Health Canada, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Academy of Sciences, have found that genetically modified food ingredients are safe and there are no negative health effects associated with their use.
GM technology adds desirable traits from nature, without introducing anything unnatural or using chemicals, so that food is more plentiful.
It is important for our consumers to know that this technology is not new. In fact, it has been around for the past 20 years, and today, 70-80% of the foods we eat in the United States, both at home and away from home, contain ingredients that have been genetically modified.1 If the ingredient label on any food or beverage product contains corn or soy, it most likely contains genetically modified ingredients, as a very high percentage of those crops grown in the U.S. use GM technology. A high percentage of other ingredients in the U.S., such as sugar beets, are grown with the use of GM technology as well.
Many ingredients grown using GM technology require fewer pesticides, less water and keep production costs down. In fact, GM technology helps reduce the price of crops used for food, such as corn, soybeans and sugar beets by as much as 15-30%.2 In addition, one in eight people among the world's growing population of seven billion do not have enough to eat, and safe and effective methods of food production, like crops produced through GM technology, can help us feed the hungry and malnourished in developing nations around the world.
PepsiCo will continue to engage in an informative dialogue with our consumers so that they understand the safety, prevalence and benefits of GM ingredients and can make informed choices for themselves and their families.

Caramel Coloring
The safety of our products is PepsiCo's top priority, and we abide by the regulatory guidelines everywhere we do business. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory agencies around the world, including the European Food Safety Authority and Health Canada, consider our caramel coloring safe for use in foods and beverages.  The FDA has been very clear and firm in this point.
While our products meet the strict FDA guidelines, when the regulatory requirements on 4-MEI changed in California, PepsiCo moved immediately to meet the new requirements and in order to maintain a harmonized supply chain globally committed to rolling out the changes across the rest of the U.S. and internationally. The work has been completed in California and several other U.S. states, and we are on track to complete the roll out by February 2014.
It is important to note that throughout this process there will be no change to the overall Pepsi-Cola product or to the great Pepsi taste consumers know and love.
PepsiCo's research processes and those of our partners are confidential for competitive reasons. However, PepsiCo does not conduct or fund research - including research funded by PepsiCo but performed by third parties - that utilizes any human tissue or cell lines derived from embryos or fetuses.
PepsiCo's Statement on Animal Testing
PepsiCo does not conduct any animal tests and does not directly fund any animal tests on its beverages and foods. Where governmental agencies require animal tests to demonstrate ingredient safety, companies using those ingredients rely on third party testing.
PepsiCo has shared our concern regarding the ethical and humane treatment of animals with our suppliers and others in the industry. We encourage the use of alternative testing methods whenever and wherever possible and have financially supported research to develop these alternative methods.
PepsiCo's Cage-Free Egg Policy
PepsiCo uses eggs in a number of our baked products including oatmeal and protein bars, biscuits and cookies. To ensure that our business practices support the more ethical and humane treatment of animals, we will expand PepsiCo's use of 100% cage-free eggs to North America by 2020 and the remainder of PepsiCo's global egg procurement by 2025.

PepsiCo Global Labeling Policy
PepsiCo is committed to helping consumers make informed choices through fact-based, simple and easy-to-understand information about how the key nutrients in each product fit in a balanced and healthy diet.
We follow nutrition labeling requirements in the countries where our products are sold, and in many places, we exceed these requirements. At a minimum, our labels will provide the following information:
Our products will provide on the side or back of our packaging nutrition information on the amount of energy (as calories, kilocalories or kilojoules), protein, carbohydrate, total sugars, total fat, saturated fat and sodium per 100g/ml or per serving. Additionally, we will include nutrition information for nutrients for which a health or nutrition claim is made.
Our products will include information on energy (as calories, kilocalories or kilojoules) per 100g/ml or per serving on front-of-pack labeling in all countries.
This policy is currently being rolled out and will be fully implemented, at the latest, by the end of 2016.

Sales and Advertising to Children
PepsiCo has taken several important steps to ensure we are employing responsible advertising practices. We joined the International Food & Beverage Alliance (IFBA), a Swiss-based NGO, comprising multinational food and beverage manufacturers, to adopt a worldwide voluntary commitment to advertise to children under the age of 12 only those products that meet specific nutrition criteria. PepsiCo also adopted a global company policy that is consistent with IFBA's policy. Initially, its implementation was focused on beverages worldwide and foods and snacks in certain markets. By the end of 2010, we had fully implemented our policy. In 2010, we announced strict science-based criteria that ensure only our most nutritious products meet the standard for advertising to children under the age of 12.
In 2012, we strengthened our Advertising to Children Policy to define advertising to children to mean that we will not buy advertising in programs with an audience profile greater than 35 percent of children under 12 years of age. Previously, our policy applied to audiences consisting of greater than 50 percent of children less than 12 years of age. This policy change is currently being rolled out and will be fully implemented by the end of 2013. Our policy continues to provide that PepsiCo will advertise only to children under 12 appropriate products that meet PepsiCo's strict, science-based nutrition criteria for advertising to children.
Again in 2014, we enhanced our Advertising to Children Policy to cover significantly more media, including outdoor, interactive games, cinema and product placement.  The enhanced policy will also ensure that marketing techniques such as licensed characters, movie tie-ins and celebrities.  This policy change is currently being rolled out and will be fully implemented, at the latest, by the end of 2016.
As verified by a third party, Accenture, in globally representative markets such as Russia, China, Colombia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand and six countries in the EU, we achieved 99 percent compliance with our Advertising to Children Policy. Additionally, we achieved 100 percent compliance with our U.S. and Canada Advertising to Children pledges, as verified by the Children's Food & Beverage Advertising Initiative in the U.S. and Advertising Standards Canada.

PepsiCo, Inc. is proud to be one of the first companies to commit as a participant in the Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI).

PepsiCo Global Policy on the Sale of Beverages to Schools
Our global policy for beverage sales in schools focuses on water, juice, milk and low-calorie beverages that support healthy nutrition habits among students. PepsiCo-owned bottling operations offer healthy hydration options for students and align with schools to eliminate full-calorie soft drinks in primary and secondary schools. We will work with our independent franchise bottlers, third-party vending companies and other PepsiCo beverage distributors, as well as schools and local authorities, to further align this policy beyond PepsiCo's direct operations. Because our policies alone cannot assure the actions of businesses outside of our operational control, it should be noted that our products may be sold in schools by independent third parties. However, we view our policy as an opportunity to engage our industry peers and local authorities in adopting similar policies. It is only through a collaborative, industry-wide effort that a full-scale implementation of such a policy can be achieved.
Downloads
Through our bottling partners and third-party distributors in the U.S., PepsiCo Beverages North America is committed to offering schools a portfolio of low-calorie and nutritious beverage choices. This wide variety of products includes, bottled waters, juices, sports drinks and no- or low-calorie carbonated soft drinks, juice-flavored drinks and iced teas. Schools decide which beverages are available, and where and when they are sold.

PepsiCo Food Service Policy for Snacks in K-12 Schools
PepsiCo Food Service (PFS) is committed to helping schools offer nutritious and lower-calorie snack choices to their students. By doing so, we can help parents and educators teach children healthy habits — in the calories they consume and the calories they burn. Although we do not decide which snacks are available on school campuses — schools do — and we do not sell snack products directly to schools — food distributors, vending companies and other independent businesses do — we believe we can play an important role in helping students have access to nutritious and lower-calorie snack choices while at school.

Environmental Sustainability Policies
PepsiCo has a number of policies and programs to compliment the PepsiCo Global Supplier Code of Conduct, which clarifies our global expectations in the areas of business integrity, labor practices, associate health and safety, and environmental management.  These standards apply to all stages of our upstream value chain and are meant to be complemented, as appropriate, by additional guidelines, specifications, and practical tools at the local or regional level, while respecting and complying with national laws and regulations.
The policies reference global standards and provide PepsiCo suppliers with our requirements.  As discussed in more detail below, there are five environmental policies and commitments related to responsible sourcing.
These policies are interconnected, complementary and created to holistically address the potential issues and challenges in agriculture production and supply chain.  All of our policies, unless otherwise noted, apply to our entire supply chain.
The policies outline our standards for establishing processes and performing assessments, as well as systems to help ensure compliance.  However we recognize that sustainable and responsible sourcing is a journey.  Non-conformance with our policies may occur, and PepsiCo has a responsibility to work to address them.  We are committed to working with our suppliers through proactive steps, such as training, as well as to assist in implementing corrective action plans when needed.  PepsiCo can have a long term positive impact by helping suppliers in this way.  In a rare case where a supplier will not implement a corrective action plan, PepsiCo reserves the right to terminate the relationship.
We believe these policies can have a broader reach beyond PepsiCo.  As we have seen with other industry-leading programs, such as the PepsiCo Sustainable Farming Initiative, suppliers realize benefits like increased yields and profits, decreased costs and improved environmental impact that can be replicated with other companies with whom they work.
Underpinning all of our policies, PepsiCo recognizes the importance of maintaining and promoting fundamental human rights in all of our operations and throughout our supply chain. Our strategies and policies work together to support the principles contained in the United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization Fundamental Principles and Labor Standards.
We operate under programs and policies that:
Provide fair and equitable wages, benefits and other conditions of employment in accordance with local laws
Recognize employees’ right to freedom of association
Provide humane and safe working conditions
Prohibit forced or child labor
Promote a workplace free of discrimination and harassment
We expect our suppliers and business partners to uphold these principles.  Our Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Assurance Program are tools we use to minimize the risk of human rights abuses throughout our supply chain.
We are proud of the policies outlined here.  However we recognize this is a journey.  We will continue to expand or enhance these policies and commitments over time as science evolves, supply chains mature and tools, practices and processes improve.
PepsiCo Land Policy
Agriculture is an integral part of PepsiCo’s supply chain. PepsiCo has zero tolerance for illegal activities in our supply chain and for land displacements of any legitimate land tenure holders, which are contrary to the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards.
As part of our land policy, we are committed to:
Zero tolerance for land displacements of any peoples, in accordance with IFC Performance Standards
Fair and legal negotiations for land acquisitions
Use of appropriate grievance mechanisms, such as the PepsiCo Speak Up! Hotline, for future dispute resolutions.
To further demonstrate our support of responsible land rights practices PepsiCo intends to join the Committee on World Food Security (CFS).
PepsiCo Forestry Stewardship Policy
PepsiCo is committed to realizing zero deforestation in our company-owned and -operated activities and supply chain. PepsiCo has a responsibility to ensure that we and our suppliers operate in accordance with applicable legal requirements and practice responsible forestry stewardship.
PepsiCo will source from suppliers that strive to:
Use sustainable forest management practices in forest they own, lease or manage to provide fiber, timber and other forest-based products.
Implement sustainable agriculture practices that enable farmers to increase production on currently farmed land and minimize impacts on the surrounding area.
Preserve biodiversity and cultural values and optimize the social, environmental and economic benefits of managed forests.
To further enhance existing programs, our Forestry Stewardship Policy establishes a zero deforestation goal through the various principles outlined in the policy below. This is consistent with our ongoing work with our partners and external organizations to affect positive change in the local communities where we live, work, and serve.
PepsiCo has long been committed to transparency on the issue of forestry and has participated in the CDP’s Forest Program since its inception. For more information, please go to:
Sustainable Agriculture Policy
The Sustainable Agriculture Policy sets PepsiCo’s standards of performance and expectations for raw materials that are sourced from agricultural production. It is designed to have global reach, be relevant for industry and agricultural crops, and be adaptable for every size farm in developing and mature markets.
The Policy outlines PepsiCo’s aspirations, principles, and goal setting approach in regards to sustainable agriculture as well as the broad environmental, economic, and social objectives within our agricultural supply chain.
Sustainable Packaging Policy
PepsiCo's Sustainable Packaging Policy outlines our commitment to strive for the smallest possible environmental footprint while still meeting the value, cost and performance criteria expected from consumers and customers. The Policy provides the framework through which we aspire to:
Increase the use of recycled content or materials from renewable sources;
Optimize packaging design to use the fewest materials necessary;
Promote the use of materials that can be recycled (beverage containers, cereal cartons, etc.);
Minimize post-industrial waste;
Avoid known negative impacts to the environment; and
Achieve a lower carbon footprint by ensuring efficient energy usage across the product lifecycle.
Human Right to Water
PepsiCo was among the first companies of our size to publicly recognize water as a basic human right. The UN defines the human right to water as all people’s right to safe, sufficient, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use. In 2009, we established and published guidelines in support of water as a fundamental human right, in the context of the World Health Organization and the UN Joint Declaration on the Human Right to Water.
PepsiCo's Environmental Compliance, Health and Safety Policy
Environmental stewardship and protecting the health and safety of our people are at the core of our values.  PepsiCo's Environmental Compliance, Health and Safety Policy was developed because we believe environmental incidents and occupational injuries and illnesses are preventable.  The Policy applies to all our operations. We implement our EHS policy through the PepsiCo Global Environmental, Health and Safety Management System (GEHSMS) and have established eight principles such as regulatory compliance, performance measurement and continuous improvement.  PepsiCo monitors company-owned operations and joint ventures where we hold a majority share.

Commitments on Palm Oil, Cane Sugar and Soy
Beyond the policies we’ve established, we are committed to implementing a third-party audit program, based on available and accepted standards, of the social, environmental and human rights aspects of our top sugar sourcing country, Brazil, by the end of 2014. We are also committed to implementing similar audit programs for our sugar supply chain in Thailand, our palm oil supply chain in Mexico and our coconut water supply chain in the Philippines by the end of 2016, or sooner if deemed possible. The assessments will include impacts related to land rights and will be conducted with the participation of affected communities. PepsiCo will provide a public summary of critical findings, including the methodology used for each assessment, and ensure appropriate discussions with relevant stakeholders. The summary of our findings from the audits conducted in Brazil were published in 2015 and the continuation of audits in Brazil, Thailand, Mexico and the Philippines are underway.  We expect to complete these audits and issue public summaries within the stated timeframe of the end of 2016. To further enhance our commitment to transparency, PepsiCo is providing the below information on palm oil, cane sugar and soy, three commodities used in our products:
Palm Oil
The top three countries from which PepsiCo sources palm oil are Indonesia, Malaysia and Mexico. We have three primary suppliers for this commodity: Cargill, Oleofinos and Aarhus. In 2015, PepsiCo purchased approximately 452,700 MT, which represents approximately 0.74% to the total global supply.
PepsiCo continues to seek the development of healthier oils, such as sunflower and corn oil, and transition from palm oil when possible.  In 2009 we initially committed to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), and its processes and standards.  We committed to exclusively purchase 100 percent certified sustainable palm oil for our products by 2015. To further bolster our commitment, we are working with our suppliers to achieve 100% traceability to the mill level by 2016.  In turn the mills will provide confirmation from the farms from which they source the palm oil.  In this way we will have a fuller understanding of our palm oil supply chain.
At the same time, we recognize that in some regions of the world, additional measures may be necessary. This is why we’ve made additional commitments, such as no further development of High Carbon Stock (HCS) Forests or High Conservation Value (HCV) Forests (including primary forests).  Further research may identify additional HCS areas, and we will review this policy on a periodic basis to determine if other classifications should be added.  The document below contains additional information on these commitments.
Cane Sugar
The top three countries from which PepsiCo sources sugar are Brazil, India and Thailand. We have three primary suppliers for this commodity: Sucden, Savola and TRR. PepsiCo purchased approximately 0.5% of the global supply of cane sugar in 2013.
PepsiCo is an active member of Bonsucro, a global nonprofit dedicated to reducing the environmental and social impacts of sugarcane production while recognizing the need for economic viability. Moving forward, PepsiCo will work with suppliers to meet a goal of sourcing 100% sustainable cane sugar by 2020. Efforts will begin in Brazil and Thailand. Recognizing that the sustainable cane sugar market is still developing, we will work with relevant stakeholders, including suppliers, to evaluate certification standards, such as Bonsucro and others, that are appropriate and applicable to our supply chain to achieve this goal.
Soy
PepsiCo only sources soy from Brazil from our supplier Bunge. In 2013, PepsiCo purchased approximately 0.06% of the global supply of soy.
We have also embedded detailed questions regarding land rights, which have been developed with third-party expertise, within the PepsiCo Sustainable Farming Initiative (SFI). The PepsiCo SFI program was launched to evaluate farmers with whom PepsiCo directly contracts. In this way PepsiCo will impact and educate its direct farmer-suppliers on this important issue, evaluating the results to ultimately ensure reflection of the PepsiCo policy.

Global Code of Conduct
At PepsiCo, we believe acting ethically and responsibly is not only the right thing to do, but also the right thing to do for our business. Our Global Code of Conduct is our road map and compass for doing business the right way. Simply put, we believe that you do business the right way when you act ethically and consistently with our values, our Code, our policies and the law. Effective October 1, 2012, PepsiCo released an updated version of its Global Code of Conduct. The updated Code addresses regulatory changes and evolving risk areas, and provides specific guidance on acting ethically and legally while performing work for PepsiCo.
Human Rights Workplace Policy
PepsiCo's Human Rights Workplace Policy is guided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and related international covenants. The principles underlying our Human Rights Workplace Policy, available in 44 languages, are broadly communicated as part of the Code of Conduct training.
PepsiCo respects the dignity of our workers in the workplace and we work to ensure our associates' rights to personal security, a safe, clean and healthful workplace, and freedom from harassment or abuse of any kind.
We deal fairly and honestly with our associates regarding wages, benefits and other conditions of employment, and recognize our associates' right to freedom of association. We do not use compulsory or child labor.
We do not tolerate discrimination and work to ensure equal opportunity for all associates.
We comply with all applicable laws, regulations and other employment standards, wherever we operate or work.
We encourage our partners, suppliers, contractors and vendors to support these policies, and we place substantial value on working with others who share our commitment to human rights.
HIV/AIDS
At PepsiCo, we recognize HIV/AIDS as a uniquely challenging global health issue that poses a significant threat to the sustainability of our business operations worldwide. We are committed to making a significant contribution to the fight against this devastating pandemic and to assisting associates and their family members affected by it. PepsiCo has established an internal task force on HIV/AIDS to guide our actions in addressing the issue in our businesses.

PepsiCo's Environmental Compliance, Health and Safety Policy was developed because we believe environmental incidents and occupational injuries and illnesses are preventable. 
We implement our EHS policy through the PepsiCo Global Environmental, Health and Safety Management System (GEHSMS) and have established eight principles such as regulatory compliance, performance measurement and continuous improvement. 
Political Activities, Political Contributions & Issue Advocacy: Policies and Guidelines
The health of democratic societies depends on citizens being responsibly engaged in the political process.  PepsiCo’s political activities – including political giving and issue advocacy -- must always comply with applicable laws and PepsiCo’s Political Activities, Contributions & Issue Advocacy Policy & Guidelines below.
Governance & Oversight
PepsiCo’s Board of Directors recognizes that the use of Company resources in the political process is an important issue for shareholders.  PepsiCo’s Board of Directors oversees the Company’s public policy processes and activities with the assistance of its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  This includes the periodic review of policies and practices regarding political contributions, as well as the review of PepsiCo’s political contributions and expenditures of both corporate and political action committee funds.
Issue Prioritization
PepsiCo’s Public Policy/Government Affairs team works with senior management to develop annual and long term public policy priorities. Such priorities include efforts to protect and advance our business and strategic goals, which are embodied as part of PepsiCo’s Performance with Purpose mission. Key issues include discriminatory taxation, trade, commodities, restrictions in the marketplace and environmental regulation.
Lobbying:  Guidelines, Reporting and Expenses
PepsiCo monitors and abides by the changing laws and regulations governing lobbying activities, including the rules regarding state and federal lobbying registration and reporting obligations. PepsiCo associates who engage in and support lobbying efforts at the US federal and state level undergo annual ethics training by expert outside counsel. PepsiCo discloses all lobbying activities at the federal, state and local level, as required by law.
PepsiCo’s quarterly federal lobbying reports can be found here . In 2014, PepsiCo spent approximately $3,510,000 on federal lobbying-related activities in the United States. In support of transparency, when reporting its lobbying activities PepsiCo uses a broad definition of lobbying-related activities, provided in the Lobbying Disclosure Act*. In addition, any consultants PepsiCo retains also must file public disclosures regarding their activities on behalf of the company as required by law.

Political Contributions (PAC and corporate funds) – Governance, Criteria, Accountability
Political contributions by PepsiCo’s political action committee – the PepsiCo Concerned Citizens Fund (CCF) – and by the company, where permitted by law, provide an important opportunity for PepsiCo and its employees to participate in the democratic process. CCF receives voluntary employee contributions to from eligible individuals to make political campaign contributions to U.S. federal and state candidates, political parties and other political committees. Management and supervisory employees who are lawful citizens/residents of the United States may voluntarily contribute to CCF. Except for administrative expenses, CCF is completely funded with voluntary contributions from eligible PepsiCo employees.
Downloads
PepsiCo has developed processes designed to further promote corporate accountability:
PepsiCo employees must obtain approval of the Corporate Vice President Public Policy & Government Affairs before making political contributions of corporate funds.
All contributions must be reviewed by the corporate law department and expert outside counsel to ensure legal compliance.
All contributions must further reflect PepsiCo’s business or strategic interest and not those of its individual officers or directors.
No contribution will be given in anticipation of, in recognition of, or in return for an official act.
Employees will not be reimbursed directly or through compensation increases for personal political contributions or expenses.
Details on all PepsiCo's political contributions will be posted on its website on an annual basis.
The following criteria will be used in connection with all contributions:
The candidate's or entity's commitment to improving the business climate;
The candidate's commitment to the long-term public policy goals of PepsiCo;
The location of PepsiCo facilities or employees within the candidate's district or state; and
The candidate's position on key committees where legislation of importance to PepsiCo is considered or the candidate's demonstrated leadership - or potential for leadership - within the U.S. Congress or a State Legislature
As a result of a 2010 US Supreme Court decision corporations may now make independent political expenditures such as sponsoring political ads in federal elections, but are still prohibited from contributing directly to federal candidates. PepsiCo has not made independent political expenditures and does not anticipate that the Court decision will impact how the company contributes or engages in the political process.
Finally, PepsiCo employees have the right to be engaged in the political process in their individual capacity as they see fit, and make political contributions of their own time and money to the candidates or parties of their choice. Of course, those efforts must not in any way suggest PepsiCo's support. Coercion of any employee to contribute to the CCF or to make any political contribution of any kind is unacceptable. In addition, an employee’s personal political affiliation or political activities shall not be the basis of adverse employment action so long as those affiliations and activities are both lawful and fully compliant with PepsiCo’s Code of Conduct.
Contribution Factors: PepsiCo seeks to support candidates who have responsible pro-business records and positions. In this way, PepsiCo seeks to improve the business climate, our quality of life and the society in which we live, enabling us to succeed as a company committed to integrity, innovation and value.
PepsiCo generally does not make contributions with corporate funds or CCF to candidates outside the United States. Any exception to this policy would require a written recommendation by PepsiCo’s regional government affairs representative and approval by (1) the Corporate Vice President of Public Policy & Government Affairs and (2) the corporate and regional law departments to ensure strict legal compliance. Any such contribution would be posted on the PepsiCo website with other political contributions.

Trade Associations
PepsiCo is a member of numerous industry and trade groups and partners with various non-profit organizations and non-governmental organizations. PepsiCo provides a list of many of those key memberships and partnerships on its website here .
PepsiCo works with these groups because they represent the food and beverage industry and the business community on issues that are critical to PepsiCo’s business and its stakeholders. Importantly, such organizations help develop consensus among varied interests.
PepsiCo does not always share or agree with all of the views of each of our peers or associations. PepsiCo representatives on the boards and committees of such groups ensure that PepsiCo’s position about policy or related activities is voiced. As such, there may be times when PepsiCo chooses not to fund certain initiatives sponsored by such organizations.
PepsiCo annually reviews the benefits and challenges from membership in our major trade associations. In addition, our trade associations are required to obtain specific consent from PepsiCo to use PepsiCo’s dues or similar payments for the funding of exceptional political expenditures beyond regular dues and business matters. PepsiCo specifically directs in writing each of its primary trade associations to use PepsiCo dues for general operating expenses and other routine activities, which includes lobbying executive and legislative bodies, and not to apply PepsiCo dues to any political event or election related activity without a specific approval from PepsiCo.
PepsiCo currently does not belong to any organizations which have as a major focus the creation and promotion of model legislation.

"Rentech, Inc.","Supply Chain Transparency
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) requires companies that manufacture or sell products and operate in the State of California to provide information regarding their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their direct supply chains. The law was designed to increase consumers’ knowledge about products they buy and the companies they choose to support.
Rentech, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Rentech”) are committed to complying with applicable law wherever we operate and conducting all business activities in accordance with the highest ethical standards. We expect the same of the parties with which we do business. Our ethical standard is reflected in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code”) and our Employee Handbook (“Handbook”) which outline our expectations of ethical conduct and compliance with all laws from our employees, agents and other representatives.
In addition to receiving our Code and Handbook, employees involved in procurement are provided with additional ethics and compliance training. Rentech maintains (i) a 24/7 whistleblower hotline where employees can anonymously submit any concerns of possible ethics and compliance violations, including slavery and human trafficking, and (ii) an employee concern program established to address employee concerns openly and in an objective manner. Every concern that is submitted under either program is reviewed and handled accordingly. Any employee or contractor who is found to have violated the Code or Handbook is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contracts, as the case may be, and referral to appropriate legal authorities.
Rentech expects its suppliers to comply with legal requirements and operate consistently with the principles of the Code when working on our behalf. Accordingly, we consider these issues when we assess potential suppliers and typically require suppliers to represent in the applicable supply agreement that their performance under such agreement will be in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. While Rentech does not have a formal verification program, we do perform periodic audits of suppliers to evaluate and address issues relating to compliance with laws and regulations and Rentech’s policies, processes and procedures.
